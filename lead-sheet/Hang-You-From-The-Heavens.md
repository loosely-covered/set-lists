# Hang You From The Heavens {short="Hang You ... Heavens"}  

I never know how to treat you  
You think I love you but it ain't true  
I'm walking away now  
One step forward and back two  
I like to grab you by the hair  
and hang you up from the heavens  
I don't know how to let you go  
Or if i should keep you  
I don't know how to let you know  
I really do have a reason  
I like to grab you by the hair  
and drag you to the devil  
(Drums)  
I never know how to push you  
Just to... Just to confuse you  
I make my hope, Just to see how  
Just to see how  
to push you  
I like to grab you by the hair  
and hang you up from the heavens  
(Drums)  
I 'd like to grab you by the hair  
and send you up to the devil  
I never know what mood you be  
You may be kind or cruel to me  
I'm walking away now  
one step forward and back three  
(Drums)  
I never know what I'm gonna to do  
I say I'm leaving, but It ain't true  
I got a lot to do to you  
There ain't nothing you can do... to stop it  
I want to hang you by the hair  
I want to hang you by the hair  
I want to hang you by the hair  
and hang you up from the heavens
