# Happy  

### Intro  8x  

### Verse  16x  

It might seem crazy what I'm bout to say  
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break  
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space  
With the air, like I don't care, baby, by the way
huh  
  
### Chorus  16x  

(Because I'm happy)  
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof  
(Because I'm happy)  
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth  
(Because I'm happy)  
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you  
(Because I'm happy)  
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do  
  
### Verse  16x  

Here come bad news, talking this and that (Yeah!)  
Give me all you got, don't hold it back (Yeah!)  
I should probably warn you I'll be just fine (Yeah!)  
No offense to you, don't waste your time  
here's why
