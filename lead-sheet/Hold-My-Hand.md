With a little love,  
and some tenderness

We'll take the world together,  
We'll take 'em by the hand

Yesterday, I saw you standing there  
Your head was down,

and let me see you smile  
We'll take a walk together  
Walk the road awhile, 'cause

### Verse  8x  

See I was wasted,
and I was wasting time  
'Till I thought about your problems,
I thought about your crimes

I don't wanna be part of your problems  
Don't wanna be part of your crowd, no
