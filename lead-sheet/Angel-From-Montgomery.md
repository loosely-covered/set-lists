# Angel from Montgomery {short="Angel ... Montgomery"}  

### Intro  ?x  

### Verse 1  ?x

I am an old woman named after my mother  
My old man is another child that's grown old  
If dreams were lightnin' and thunder were desire  
This old house would've burned down a long time ago  

### Chorus  ?x

Make me an Angel that flies from Montgomery  
Make me a poster of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing that I can hold onto  
To believe in this livin' is just a hard way to go  

### Verse 2  ?x

When I was a young girl, well, I had me a cowboy  
Weren't much to look at just a free ramblin' man  
But that was a long time and no matter how I try  
The years just flow by like a broken down dam  

### Chorus  ?x

Make me an Angel that flies from Montgomery  
Make me a poster of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing that I can hold onto  
To believe in this livin' is just a hard way to go  

### Verse 3  ?x

There's flies in the kitchen, I can hear 'em in there buzzin'  
And I ain't done nothin' since I woke up today  
How the hell can a person go to work in the mornin'  
And come home in the evenin' and have nothin' to say?  

### Chorus  ?x

Make me an Angel that flies from Montgomery  
Make me a poster of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing that I can hold onto  
To believe in this livin' is just a hard way to go  
To believe in this livin' is just a hard way to go
