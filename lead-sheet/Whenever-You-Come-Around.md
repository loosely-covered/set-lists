# Whenever You Come Around {short="Whenever ... Around"}  

### Intro  4x  

### Verse 1  8x

The face of an angel, pretty eyes that shine  
I lie awake at night wishing you were mine  
I'm standing here holding the biggest heartache in town  
Whenever you come around  

### Chorus  8+2x

I get weak in the knees and I lose my breath  
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come I'm so scared to death  
And when you smile that smile, the world turns upside down  
Whenever you come around  

### Verse 2  8x

And I feel so helpless I feel just like a kid  
What is it about you that makes me keep my feelings hid  
I wish I could tell you, bu the words can't be found  
Whenever you come around  

### Harmony Chorus  8+2x

I get weak in the knees and I lose my breath  
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come I'm so scared to death  
And when you smile that smile, the world turns upside down  
Whenever you come around  

### Guitar Solo  8x

### Chorus  8+2x

I get weak in the knees and I lose my breath  
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come I'm so scared to death  
And when you smile that smile, the world turns upside down  
Whenever you come around  

### Chorus  10+2x

And when you smile that smile  
The whole world turns upside down  
Whenever you come around  
Whenever you come around
