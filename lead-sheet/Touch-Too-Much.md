# Touch Too Much  
  
It was one of those nights  
When you turned out the lights  
And everything comes into view  
She was taking her time  
I was losing my mind  
There was nothing that she wouldn't do  
It wasn't the first  
It wasn't the last  
She knew we was making love  
I was so satisfied  
Deep down inside  
Like a hand in a velvet glove  
  
Chorus:  
Seems like a touch, a touch too much  
Seems like a touch, a touch too much  
Too much for my body, too much for my brain  
This kind of woman's gonna drive me insane  
She's got a touch, a touch too much  
  
She had the face of an angel  
Smiling with sin  
A body of venus with arms  
Dealing with danger  
Stroking my skin  
Let the thunder and lightening start  
It wasn't the first  
It wasn't the last  
It wasn't that she didn't care  
She wanted it hard  
And wanted it fast  
She liked it done medium rare  
  
Chorus  
  
Seems like a touch, touch too much  
You know it's much too much, much too much  
I really want to feel your touch too much  
Girl you know you're getting me much too much  
Seems like a touch  
Just a dirty little touch  
I really need your touch  
Cause you're much too much too much  
  
Chorus
