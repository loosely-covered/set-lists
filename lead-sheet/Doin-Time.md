### Intro  2x
  
### Chorus  8x  

Summertime, and the livin's easy  
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.  
All the people in the dance will agree  
That we're well qualified to represent the L.B.C.  
Me, me and Louie, we gon' run to the party  
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder  
  
### Verse  8x  

Me and my girl, we got this relationship  
I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit  
On lock down like a penitentiary  
She spreads her lovin' all over  
And when she gets home, there's none left for me

And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder  
  
### Verse  8x  

Oh, take this veil from off my eyes  
My burning sun will, some day, rise  
So, what am I gonna be doin' for a while?  
Said, I'm gonna play with myself  
Show them, now, we've come off the shelf

### Breakdown  8x  

Evil, I've come to tell you that she's evil, most definitely  
Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely  
The tension, it's getting hotter  
I'd like to hold her head underwater  
Summertime ...
