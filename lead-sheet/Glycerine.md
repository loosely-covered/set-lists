# Glycerine

It must be your skin I'm sinking in  
Must be for real 'cause now I can feel  
And I didn't mind, it's not my kind  
It's not my time to wonder why  
Every thing's gone white and every thing's gray  
Now you're here, now you're away  
I don't want this, remember that  
I'll never forget where you're at  
Don't let the days go by, Glycerine, Glycerine  
I'm never alone, I'm alone all the time  
Are you at one or do you lie  
We live in a wheel where everyone steals  
But when we rise, it's like strawberry fields  
If I treated you bad, you bruise my face  
Couldn't love you more, you got a beautiful taste  
Don't let the days go by  
Could have been easier on you  
I couldn't change though I wanted to  
Should have been easier by three  
Our old friend 'Fear' and you and me  
Glycerine, Glycerine  
Don't let the days go by, Glycerine  
Don't let the days go by, Glycerine, Glycerine  
Glycerine, Glycerine  
Bad mood whine again  
Bad mood whine again  
As she falls around me  
I needed you more when we wanted us less  
I could not kiss, just regress  
It might just be clear, simple and plain  
Well, that's just fine, that's just one of my names  
Don't let the days go by  
Could have been easier on you, you, you  
Glycerine, Glycerine, Glycerine, Glycerine
