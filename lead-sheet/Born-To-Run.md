# Born To Run

### Intro Vamp  8x

### Verse  8x
In the day we sweat it out on the streets
of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through mansions of glory
in suicide machines

### B Section  14x
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected, and steppin' out over the line
Oh, baby, this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap

We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us
Baby, we were born to-

### Intro Vamp  8x
-runnnnnnnnnn
...
Yes, girl, we were
...

### Verse  8x
Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend
I wanna guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines

### B Section  14x
Together we could break this trap
We'll run 'til we drop, baby, we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
'Cause, baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider

But I gotta know how it feels
I wanna know if love is wild
Babe, I want to know if love is-

### Intro Vamp  8x
-realllllllllll
...
Oh, can you show me?
...

### Sax Solo  12x

### Bridge 1  16x
Beyond the Palace, hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in rear-view mirrors, and the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark, kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the streets tonight in an everlasting kiss

### Bridge 2  17x
_pause at the end_
1-2-3-4!

### Verse  8x
The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last-chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight, but there's no place left to hide

### B Section  14x
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday, girl, I don't know when 
We're gonna get to that place where we really wanna go 

And we'll walk in the sun
But 'til then tramps like us
Baby, we were born to-

### Intro Vamp  8x
-runnnnnnnnnn
Oh, honey, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to runnnnn
Come on, Wendy, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to-

### Intro Vamp  8x
-runnnnnnnnnn
Whoah-oh-oh
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Uh-uh-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ru-uh-uh-uh-ohhhh

### Intro Vamp  8x

Ru-uh-uh-uh-ohhhh
