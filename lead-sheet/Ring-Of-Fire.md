# Ring Of Fire

Love is a burning thing  
And it makes a fiery ring  
Bound by ones desire  
I fell down into a ring of fire  
I fell into a burning ring of fire  
Went down, down, down and the flames went higher  
And it burns, burns, burns that ring of fire, that ring of fire  
The taste of love is sweet  
When hearts like ours meet  
I hide before you like a child  
Oh but the fire went wild  
I fell into a burning ring of fire  
Went down, down, down and the flames went higher  
And it burns, burns, burns that ring of fire, that ring of fire and it burns  
I fell into a burning ring of fire  
Went down, down, down and the flames went higher  
And it burns, burns, burns that ring or fire that ring of fire  
The taste of love is sweet  
When hearts like ours meet  
I hide before you like a child  
Oh but the fire went wild  
I fell into a burning ring of fire  
Went down, down, down and the flames went higher  
And it burns, burns, burns that ring of fire, that ring of fire  
One more time  
I fell into a burning ring of fire  
Went down, down, down and the flames went higher  
And it burns, burns, burns that ring of fire, that ring of fire  
That ring of fire, that ring of fire
