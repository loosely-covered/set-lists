# TroubleMaker

Put me in a special school  
'Cause I am such a fool  
And I don't need a single book  
To teach me how to read  
Who needs stupid books?  
They are for petty crooks  
And I will learn by studying  
The lesson in my dreams  
So turn off the TV  
'Cause that's what others see  
And movies are as bad as  
Eating chocolate ice cream  
They only sicken me  
Don't let me play football  
I'll sack the quarterback  
And jack the brother of the ball  
I'm a troublemaker  
Never been a faker  
Doing things my own way  
And never giving up  
I'm a troublemaker  
Not a double taker  
I don't have the patience  
To keep it on the up  
I picked up a guitar  
What does this signify?  
I'm gonna play some heavy metal riffs  
And you will die  
You wanted arts and crafts  
How's this for arts and crafts?  
That's right  
I'm growing out my hair  
I'm movin' out to Cherokee  
I'm gonna be a rock star  
And you will go to bed with me  
'Cause I can't work a job  
Like any other slob  
Punchin' in and punchin' out  
And suckin' up to Bob  
Marrying a bitch  
Having 7 kids  
Giving up and growing old  
And hoping there's a God  
I'm a troublemaker  
Never been a faker  
Doing things my own way  
And never giving up  
I'm a troublemaker  
Not a double taker  
I don't have the patience  
To keep it on the up  
I'm gonna be a star  
And people will crane necks  
To get a glimpse of me  
And see if I am having sex  
In studying my moves  
They try to understand  
Why I am so unlike the singers  
In the other bands  
I'm such a mystery  
As anyone can see  
There isn't anybody else  
Exactly quite like me  
And when it's party time  
Like 1999  
I'll party by myself  
Because I'm such a special guy  
I'm a troublemaker  
Never been a faker  
Doing things my own way  
And never giving up  
I'm a troublemaker  
Not a double taker  
I don't have the patience  
To keep it on the up  
(Keep it on the up)  
I'm a troublemaker  
(Keep it on the up)  
I'm a troublemaker  
(Keep it on the up)  
I'm a troublemaker  
(Keep it on the up)  
I'm a troublemaker  
Never giving up
