# Never Let You Go

There's every good reason  
For letting you go  
She's sneaky and smoked out  
And it's starting to show  
I'll never let you go  
I'll never let you go  
I'll never let you go  
I'll never let you turn around your back on each other  
That's a good idea, break a promise to your mother  
Turn around your back on each other  
You say that I've changed  
Well maybe I did  
But even if I've changed  
What's wrong with it?  
I'll never let you go  
I'll never let you go  
I'll never let you go  
I'll never let you turn around your back on each other  
That's a good idea, break a promise to your mother  
Turn around your back on each other  
And our friends are gone and gone  
And all the time moves on and on  
And all I know is it's wrong, it's wrong  
And all I know is it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong  
If there's a reason  
It's lost on me  
Maybe we'll be friends  
I guess we'll see  
I'll never let you go  
I'll never let you go  
I'll never let you go  
I'll never let you go  
Turn around, your back on each other  
It's a good idea, break a promise to your mother  
Turn around let's turn on each other  
Good idea, break a promise to your mother  
Turn around your back on each other  
That's a good idea, break a promise to your mother  
Turn around your back on each other  
What a good idea  
I remember the stupid things, the mood rings  
The bracelets and the beads  
Nickels and dimes, yours and mine, did you cash in all your dreams?  
You don't dream for me, no, you don't dream for me, no  
(Goodbye, goodbye)  
But I still feel you pulse like sonar from the days in the waves  
That girl is like a sunburn  
I would like to say  
The girl is like a sunburn  
I would like to say  
She's like a sunburn  
(She's like a sunburn)  
She's like a sunburn
