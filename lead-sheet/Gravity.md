# Gravity

Gravity is working against me  
And gravity wants to bring me down  
Oh, I'll never known what makes this man  
With all the love that his heart can stand  
Dream of ways to throw it all away  
Whoa, gravity is working against me  
And gravity wants to bring me down  
Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good  
And can't sustain like one half could  
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees  
Oh twice as much ain't twice as good  
And can't sustain like one half could  
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees  
Whoa, gravity, stay the hell away from me  
Whoa, gravity has taken better men than me  
Now how can that be?  
Just keep me where the light is  
Just keep me where the light is  
Just keep me where the light is  
Come on keep me where the light is  
Come on keep me where, keep me where the light is.
