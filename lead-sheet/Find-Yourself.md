### Verse  16x  
  
Well I don't mind sleeping alone  
If it means I don't have to play your crazy games no more  
You're the most precious thing I've ever seen  
But I ain't gonna let it slide when you're mean to me

### Chorus  16x  (_third-above_)  
  
And I hope you find yourself  
Before I find somebody else to be my lover  
And I hope you find yourself  
Before I find somebody else to be my lover  
  
### Verse  16x  
  
Well, you tell me things I wanna hear  
You want me near, and I know you feel me leaving you  
You think that I won't say goodbye  
But baby I ain't standing by while you stretch the truth
