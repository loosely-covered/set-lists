# Let s Go Crazy

Dearly beloved, we have gathered here today  
To get through this thing called life  
Electric word life it means forever and that's a mighty long time  
But I'm here to tell you there's something else  
The afterworld, a world of never ending happiness  
You can always see the sun, day or night  
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills  
You know the one Dr. Everything'll Be Alright  
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left?  
Ask him how much of your mind, baby  
'Cause in this life things are much harder than in the afterworld  
This life you're on your own  
And if the elevator tries to bring you down  
Go crazy punch a higher floor  
If you don't like the world you're living in  
Take a look around you at least you got friends  
Come on lady for friendly word  
She picked up the phone, dropped it on the floor  
Ahh, ahh is all I heard  
Are we gonna let the elevator  
Bring us down, oh, no let's go  
Let's go crazy, let's get nuts  
Look for the purple banana  
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go  
All excited but we don't know why  
Maybe it's 'cause we're all gonna die  
And when we do, what's it all for  
Better live now before the grim reaper  
Come knocking on your door  
Are we gonna let the elevator  
Bring us down, oh, no let's go  
Let's go crazy, let's get nuts  
Look for the purple banana  
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go  
Come on baby let's get nuts  
Yeah, crazy  
Let's go crazy  
Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down  
Oh, no let's go, go crazy  
I said let's go, go crazy  
Let's go, let's go, go, let's go  
Dr. Everything'll Be Alright  
Make everything go wrong  
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill  
Hang tough children  
He's comin'  
He's comin'  
Comin'  
Take me away
