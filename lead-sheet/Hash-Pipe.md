# Hash Pipe


### Intro  4x

### Verse  8x
I can’t help my feelings, I’ll go out of my mind  
These players come to get me ’cause they’d like my behind  
I can’t love my business if I can’t get a trick  
Down on Santa Monica where tricks are for kids  

### Chorus  16x
Oh, come on and kick me  
Oh, come on and kick me  
Come on and kick me  
You’ve got your problems  
I’ve got my ass wipe  
You’ve got your big cheese  
I’ve got my hash pipe  

### Intro  4x

### Verse  8x
I can’t help my boogies they get out of control  
I know that you don’t care but I want you to know  
The knee stocking flavor is a favorite treat  
Of men that don’t bother with the taste of a teat
