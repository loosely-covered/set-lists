# Bent

If I fall along the way  
Pick me up and dust me off  
And if I get too tired to make it  
Be my breath so I can walk  
If I need some other love, then  
Give me more than I can stand  
And when my smile gets old and faded  
Wait around I'll smile again  
Shouldn't be so complicated  
Just hold me and then  
Oh, just hold me again  
Can you help me I'm bent  
I'm so scared that I'll never  
Get put back together  
Keep breaking me in  
And this is how we will end  
With you and me bent  
If I couldn't sleep, could you sleep?  
Could you paint me better off?  
Could you sympathize with my needs?  
I know you think I need a lot  
I started out clean but I'm jaded  
Just phoning it in  
Oh, just breaking the skin  
Can you help me I'm bent  
I'm so scared that I'll never  
Get put back together  
Keep breaking me in  
And this is how we will end  
With you and me bent  
Start bending me, it's never enough  
As I feel all your pieces  
Start bending me, keep bending me  
Oh, until I'm completely broken in  
Shouldn't be so complicated  
Just touch me and then  
Oh, just touch me again  
Can you help me I'm bent  
I'm so scared that I'll never  
Get put back together  
Keep breaking me in  
And this is how we will end  
With you and me will let them  
Without understanding  
Here I go there again  
Can you help me I'm bent  
I'm so scared that I'll never  
Get put back together  
Yeah, you're breaking me in  
And this is how we will end  
With you and me bent
