# Feeling Alright

### Intro  4x  

### Verse 1  12x
Seems I've got to have a change of scene  
'Cause every night I have the strangest dreams  
Imprisoned by the way it could have been  
Left here on my own or so it seems  
I've got to leave before I start to scream  
Won't someone lock the door and turn the key  

### Chorus  8x
Feeling alright  
I'm not feeling too good myself  
Feeling alright  
I'm not feeling that good myself  

### Verse 2  12x
Boy you sure took me for a ride  
And even now I sit and wonder why  
That when I think of you  
I stop myself from crying  
I just can't waist my time  
I must keep trying  
I've got to stop believing all your lies  
'Cause there's to much to do before I die  

### Chorus  8x
Feeling alright  
I'm not feeling too good myself  
Feeling alright  
I'm not feeling that good myself  

### Solo  8x

### Break  ?x

### Verse 3  12x
Don't you get to lost in all I say  
But at the time you know, I really felt that way  
But that was then and now you know its today  
I can't escape I guess I'm here to stay  
Till someone comes along to take my place  
With a different name and a different face  

### Chorus  8x
Feeling alright  
I'm not feeling that good myself  
Feeling alright  
I'm not feeling that good myself  
(repeat Chorus 2 more times)
