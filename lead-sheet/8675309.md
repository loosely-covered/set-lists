Hey  
Jenny, Jenny, who can I turn to?  
You give me something I can hold onto  
I know you think I'm like the others before  
Who saw your name and number on the wall  
Jenny, I've got your number  
I need to make you mine  
Jenny, don't change your number

Jenny, Jenny, you're the girl for me  
You don't know me but you make me so happy  
I tried to call you before but I lost nerve  
I tried my imagination but I was disturbed  
Jenny, I've got your number  
I need to make you mine  
Jenny, don't change your number

I got your number on the wall  
I got it, I got it  
(I got it)  
For a good time  
For a good time call
