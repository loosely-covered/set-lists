# Thank You

### Verse  8x  

If the sun refused to shine,  
I would still be loving you.  
When mountains crumble to the sea,  
There will still be you and me.  
  
### Pre-chorus  4x  

Kind woman, I give you my all.  
Kind woman, nothing more.  
  
### Chorus  8x  

Little drops of rain  
Whisper of the pain.  
Tears of love lost in the days gone by.  
  
My love is strong,  
With you there is no wrong.  
Together we shall go until we die.  
  
### Pre-chorus  4x  

An inspiration's what you are to me.  
Inspiration, look, see.

Your hand in mine, we walk the miles,  

Thanks to you it will be done,  
For you to me are the only one.

Happiness: no more be sad,  
Happiness: I'm glad.
