### Verse 1  8x  

If the sun refused to shine,  
I would still be loving you  
When mountains crumble to the sea,  
There will still be you and me  
  
### Pre-chorus  4x  

Kind woman, I give you my heart  
Kind woman, nothing more  
  
### Chorus  8x  

Little drops of rain  
Whisper of the pain  
Tears of love lost in the days gone by  
  
My love is strong,  
With you there is no wrong.  
Together we shall go until we die.  
  
### Pre-chorus  4x  

An inspiration is what you are to me  
Inspiration, look, seeeeee

Happiness, no more be sad,
