# Thank You  
  
### Guitar Vamp  4x
  
### Verse  

If the sun refused to shine,  
I would still be loving you.  
When mountains crumble to the sea,  
There will still be you and me.  
  
### Pre-chorus  

Kind woman, I give you my all.  
Kind woman, nothing more.  
  
### Chorus  

Little drops of rain  
Whisper of the pain.  
Tears of love lost in the days gone by.  
  
My love is strong,  
With you there is no wrong.  
Together we shall go until we die.  
  
My, my, my.  
  
### Pre-chorus  

An inspiration's what you are to me.  
Inspiration, look, see.

And so today my world â€” it smiles,  
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles,  
Thanks to you it will be done,  
For you to me are the only one.  
.. Alright, yeah  
  
### Pre-chorus  

Happiness: no more be sad,  
Happiness: I'm glad.  
  
### Verse  

If the sun refused to shine,  
I would still be loving you.  
Mountains crumble to the sea,  
There will still be you and me.
