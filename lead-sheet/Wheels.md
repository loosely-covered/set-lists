# Wheels

I know what you're thinking  
We were going down  
I could feel us sinking  
Then I came around  
And everyone I loved before  
Flashed before my eyes  
And nothing mattered anymore  
I looked into the sky  
Well I wanted something better man  
I wished for something new  
Well I wanted something beautiful  
I wished to something true  
Ain't looking for a reason man  
Something to lose  
When the wheels come down  
(When the wheels come down)  
When the wheels touch ground  
(When the wheels touch ground)  
And you feel like its all over  
Here's another round for you  
When the wheels come down  
(When the wheels come down)  
I know your head is spinning  
Broken hearts will mend  
This is our beginning  
Coming to an end  
Well you wanted something better man  
You wished for something new  
Well you wanted something beautiful  
Wished to something true  
Been looking for a reason man  
Something to lose  
When the wheels come down  
(When the wheels come down)  
When the wheels touch ground  
(When the wheels touch ground)  
And you feel like its all over  
Here's another round for you  
When the wheels come down  
(When the wheels come down)  
When the wheels come down  
(When the wheels come down)  
When the wheels touch ground  
(When the wheels touch ground)  
And you feel like its all over  
Here's another round for you  
When the wheels come down  
(When the wheels come down)  
When the wheels come down  
(When the wheels come down)  
When the wheels touch ground  
(When the wheels touch ground)  
And you feel like its all over  
Here's another round for you  
When the wheels come down  
(When the wheels come down)
