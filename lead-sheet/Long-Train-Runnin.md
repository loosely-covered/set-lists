# Long Train Runnin

Down around the corner half a mile from here  
See them long trains runnin' and you watch 'em disappear  
Without love  
Where would you be now?  
(without love...)  
Know I saw Miss Lucy down along the tracks  
She lost her home and her family and she won't be coming back  
Without love  
Where would you be right now?  
(without love...)  
Well the Illinois Central and the Southern Central freight  
Got to keep on pushin' mama  
'Cause you know they're runnin' late  
Without love  
Where would you be now na na now?  
(without love...)  
Well the Illinois Central and the Southern Central freight  
Got to keep on pushin' mama  
'Cause you know they're runnin' late  
Without love  
Where would you be now?  
(without love...)  
Well pistons keep on churnin' and the wheels go 'round and 'round  
And the steel rails lie cold and hard on the mountains they go down  
Without love  
Where would you be right now?  
(without love...)  
Ooh...  
Where would you be now?  
Mmm... got to get you baby baby  
Won't you move it down?  
Won't you move it down?  
Baby baby baby baby  
Won't you move it down?  
When the big train run  
When the train I'm movin' on  
I got to keep on movin' keep on movin'  
Won't you keep on movin'?  
Won't you keep on movin'?
