### Intro  8x

### Intro Vamp  8x

### Verse  8x  
I'ts all the same
Only the names will change
Everyday ..
it seems were wasting away.  

Another place
where the faces are so cold  
I drive all night
just to get back home.  

### Chorus  6x
I'm a cowboy. 
On a steel horse I ride  
I'm wanted,
dead or alive.  
Wanted _no-echo_
dead or alive.  

### Intro Vamp  4x

### Verse  8x 
Somtimes I sleep
sometimes it's not for days.  
Now people like me
must go their seperate ways.  

Sometimes you'll tell the day
by the bottle that you drink.  
Sometimes when your alone
all you do is think.

### Chorus  6x

### Verse  8x 
I walk these streets
a loaded six string on my back  
I play for keeps
'cause I might not make it back.  

I've been everywhere (oh yeah)
standing tall  
_double_
I've seen a million faces 
and I've rocked them all.

Cause I'm a cowboy. 
On a steel horse I ride  
I'm wanted (wanted)

I'm a cowboy. 
I've got the night on my side  
I'm wanted (wanted)
dead or alive.  

### Outro Chorus  4x
And I ride
Dead or alive. 
I still drive
Dead or alive. 

### Outro Chorus  4x
Dead or alive.  
Dead or alive.  
Dead or alive.  
Dead or alive.
