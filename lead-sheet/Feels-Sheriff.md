### Sheriff Intro  4x  

### Feels Verse  16x  

Hey! No-nothing ever last forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe

Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)

### Feels Chorus  10x  

Don't be afraid to catch feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Hey)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me

### Feels Verse  16x  

I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity

Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you? (Oh, yeah)
To memorize the way you shock me (Yeah)
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)

### Sheriff Chorus  8x  

(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy.
(oh no! Oh!)
(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot no deputy.
(ooh, ooh, oo-ooh.)  

### Sheriff Verse  12x + 2  

Yeah! All around in my home town,
They're tryin' to track me down;
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy,
For the life of a deputy.
But I say:

### Sheriff Chorus  8x  

### Sheriff Verse  12x + 2  

Sheriff John Brown always hated me,
For what, I don't know.
Every time I plant a seed,
He said kill it before it grow -
He said kill them before they grow.
And so:

### Sheriff Chorus  8x  

### Sheriff Verse  12x + 2  

Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town, yeah!
All of a sudden I saw sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down,
So I shot - I shot - I shot him down and I say:
If I am guilty I will pay.
