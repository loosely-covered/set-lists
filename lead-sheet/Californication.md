# Californication


### Guitar 4x

### Intro  4x  

### Verse  6x
Psychic spies from China  
Try to steal your mind's elation  
And little girls from Sweden  
Dream of silver screen quotations  
And if you want these kind of dreams  
It's Californication  

### Break  4x

### Verse  6x
It's the edge of the world  
And all of Western civilization  
The sun may rise in the east  
At least it settled in a final location  
It's understood that Hollywood  
Sells Californication  

### Break  4x

### Chorus  12x
Pay your surgeon very well  
To break the spell of aging  
Celebrity skin is this your chin  
Or is that war you're waging  
First born unicorn  
Hard core soft porn  
Dream of Californication (x2)  

### Break  4x

### Verse  6x
Marry me girl, be my fairy to the world  
Be my very own constellation  
A teenage bride with a baby inside  
Getting high on information  
And buy me a star on the boulevard  
It's Californication  

### Break  4x

### Verse  6x
Space may be the final frontier  
But it's made in a Hollywood basement  
And Cobain can you hear the spheres  
Singing songs off station to station  
And Alderaan's not far away  
It's Californication  

### Break  4x  
oooo oooo (x2)

### Chorus  16x
Born and raised by those who praise  
Control of population  
Everybody's been there  
And I don't mean on vacation  
First born unicorn  
Hard core soft porn  
Dream of Californication (x4) 

### Guitar Solo  15x

### Break  4x

### Verse  6x
Destruction leads to a very rough road  
But it also breeds creation  
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar  
They're just another good vibration  
And tidal waves couldn't save the world  
From Californication  

### Break  4x  
oooo oooo (x2)

### Chorus  16x
Pay your surgeon very well  
To break the spell of aging  
Sicker then the rest there is no test  
But this is what you're craving  
First born unicorn  
Hard core soft porn  
Dream of Californication (x4)
