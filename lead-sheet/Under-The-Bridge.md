# Under The Bridge

### Intro  8x  

### Verse 1  8x
Sometimes I feel  
Like I don't have a partner  
Sometimes I feel  
Like my only friend  
Is the city I live in,  
The city of Angel  
Lonely as I am  
Together we cry  

### Break  2x

### Verse 2  8x
I drive on her streets 'cause  
She's my companion  
I walk through her hills 'cause  
She knows who I am  
She sees my good deeds and  
She kisses the windy  
I never worry now that is a lie

### Chorus  12x
I don't ever wanna feel  
Like I did that day  
Take me to the place I love  
Take me all the way

Like I did that day  
Take me to the place I love  
Take me all the way yeah yeah yeah

It's hard to believe

Lonely as I am  
Together we cry
