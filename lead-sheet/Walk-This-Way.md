# Walk This Way

Backstroke lover always hidin' 'neath the covers  
'Til I talked to your daddy he say  
He said you ain't seen nothin' 'til you're down on a MUFF AND  
Then you're sure to be a changin' your way  
I met a cheerleader was a real young breeder  
Oh the times I could reminisce  
'Cause the best things of lovin' with her sister and her cousin  
Only started with a little kiss  
A like this  
See saw swingin' with the boys in the school  
And your feet flyin' up in the air  
Singin' hey diddle diddle  
With your kitty in the middle of the swing like you didn't care  
So I took a big chance at the high school dance  
With a missy who was ready to play  
Wasn't me she was foolin' 'cause she knew what she was doin'  
And I know love was here to stay  
When she told me to  
Walk this way  
Walk this way  
Walk this way  
Walk this way  
Walk this way  
Walk this way  
Walk this way  
Walk this way  
A just gimme a kiss

School girl sweetie with a sassy kinda classy  
Little skirt's climbin' way up the knee  
It was three young ladies in a school gym locker  
When I noticed they were lookin' at me  
I was a high school loser never made it with a lady  
'Til the boys told me something I missed  
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor  
So I gave her just a little kiss  
A like this  
Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school  
And your feet flyin' up in the air  
I sing hey diddle diddy  
Wit'cha kitty in the middle of the swing like ya didn't care  
So I took a big chance at the high school dance  
With a missy who was ready to play  
Wasn't me she was foolin' 'cause she knew what she was doin'  
When she told me how to walk this way  
She told me to  
Walk this way  
Talk this way  
Walk this way  
Walk this way  
Walk this way  
Walk this way  
Walk this way  
Talk this way  
A just gimme a kiss
