# Across The Universe


### Guitar 1x + 2x

### Verse

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe

### Verse
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
..
Jai guru de va om

### Chorus   8x
Nothing's gonna change my world (x4)

### Verse
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,

### Verse
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
..
Jai guru de va om

### Chorus   8x
Nothing's gonna change my world (x4)

### Verse
Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om

### Chorus   8x
Nothing's gonna change my world (x4)

### Chorus   8x
Jai guru de va, jai guru de va
Jai guru de va, jai guru de va
Jai guru de va, Jai guru de va,
jai guru de va
