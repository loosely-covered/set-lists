# The Middle


### Intro  8x

### Verse  16x
Hey  
don't write yourself off yet  
It's only in your head you feel left out  
or looked down on  

Just try your best  
try everything you can  
And don't you worry what they tell themselves  
when you're away  

### Chorus  8x
It just takes some time, Little girl  
you're in the middle of the ride  
Everything, everything will be just fine  
Everything, everything will be alright, alright  

### Verse  16x
Hey  
you know they're all the same  
You know you're doing better on your own,  
so don't buy in  

Live right now  
just be yourself    
It doesn't matter if it's good enough  
for someone else  

### Chorus  8x

### Chorus  8x

### Solo  16x

### Verse  16x
Hey  
don't write yourself off yet  
It's only in your head you feel left out  
or looked down on  

Just do your best  
do everything you can  
And don't you worry what the bitter hearts  
are gonna say
