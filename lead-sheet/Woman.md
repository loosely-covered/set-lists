# Woman

Woman, you know you, woman  
You gotta be a woman  
I've got to feeling alone  
When you're talking to me  
See right through me  
I've got to feeling alone  
She's a woman  
You know what I mean  
You better listen, listen to me  
She's gonna set you free  
You've come looking for me  
Like I've got to set you free  
You know I can't free nobody  
You've come looking for me  
Like I've got to set you free  
I can't be nobody  
She's a woman  
You know what I mean  
You better listen, listen to me  
She's gonna set you free  
Woman, you know you, woman  
You gotta be a woman  
I've got to feeling alone  
When you're talking to me  
You see right through me  
I've got to feeling alone  
She's a woman  
You know what I mean  
You better listen, listen to me  
She's gonna set you free
