# Rebel Yell


### Intro  .

### Verse  16x
Last night a little dancer  
came dancing to my door  
Last night a little angel  
came pumping on the floor  

She said, come on baby  
You got a license for love  
And if it expires  
pray help from above, because  

### Chorus  16x
in the midnight hour  
she cried more, more, more  
With a rebel yell  
she cried more, more, more  
In the midnight hour, babe  
more, more, more  
With a rebel yell  
more, more, more, more, more, more

### Verse  16x
She don't like slavery  
she won't sit and beg  
But when I'm tired and lonely  
she sees me to bed  

What set you free  
and brought you to me, babe  
What set you free  
I need you here by me  
because

Collects it to go from the seven eleven

I'd sell my soul  
for you, babe  
For money to burn
