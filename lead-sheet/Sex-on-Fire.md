# Sex on Fire

Lay where you're laying  
Don't make a sound  
I know they're watching  
They're watching  
All the commotion  
The kiddie like play  
Has people talking  
They're talking  
You, Your sex is on fire  
Dark of the alley  
The breaking of day  
Head while I'm driving  
I'm driving  
Soft lips are open  
Them knuckles are pale  
Feels like you're dying  
You're dying  
You, Your sex is on fire  
Consumed,  
With the what's to transpire  
Hot as a fever  
Rattling bones  
I could just taste it  
Taste it  
But it's not forever  
But it's just tonight  
Oh we're still the greatest  
The greatest  
The greatest  
You, Your sex is on fire  
You, Your sex is on fire  
Consumed,  
With the what's to transpire  
And you  
Your sex is on fire  
Consumed,  
With the what's to transpire
