# Brown Eyed Girl

### Intro  8x  

### Verse 1  16x
Hey, where did we go  
Days when the rains came?  
Down in the hollow  
Playin' a new game  

Laughin' and a runnin', hey hey  
Skippin' and a jumpin'  
In the misty mornin' fog  
With our, our hearts a thumpin'  

### Prechorus  8x
And you, my brown eyed girl  
You my brown eyed girl  

### Verse 2  16x
And whatever happened  
To Tuesday and so slow  
Going down the old mine  
With a transistor radio  

Standin' in the sunlight laughin'  
Hidin' behind a rainbow's wall  
Slippin' and a slidin'  
All along the waterfall  

### Prechorus  8x
With you, my brown eyed girl  
You my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when  
We used to sing?

Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l la te da  
Just like that  
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l la te da  
La te da  
(bass solo 4x)

### Verse 3  16x
So hard to find my way  
Now that I'm all on my own  
I saw you just the other day  
My, how you have grown  
Cast my memory back there Lord  
Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout it  
Makin' love in the green grass  
Behind the stadium

With you, my brown eyed girl  
You my brown eyed girl

We used to sing?

Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l la te da

Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l la te da
