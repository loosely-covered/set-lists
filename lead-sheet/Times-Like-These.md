I'm the one that drives away  
then follows you back home  

I am a street light shining  
I'm a wild light blinding bright  
burning off alone  

### Chorus  11x (8ths)  
it's times like these you learn to live again  
it's times like these you give and give again  
it's times like these you learn to love again  
it's times like these time and time again

### Verse 2  9x (8ths)  
I am a new day rising

I am a little divided  
do I stay or run away  
and leave it all behind?
