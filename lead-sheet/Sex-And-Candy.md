# Sex and Candy

### Verse  16x

Hangin' round downtown by myself
And I had so much time
To sit and think about myself

And then there she was
Like double cherry pie
Yeah there she was
Like disco superfly

### Break  2x

### Chorus  20x (12x + 8x)

I smell sex and candy here
Who's that lounging in my chair
Who's that casting devious stares
In my direction

Yeah Mama this surely is a dream, yeah
Yeah Mama this surely is a dream, Dig it
...

### Verse  16x

Hangin' 'round downtown by myself
And I've had too much caffeine
And I was thinkin' 'bout myself

And then there she was
In platform double suede
Yeah there she was
Like disco lemonade

### Break  2x

### Chorus  20x (12x + 12x)

I smell sex and candy here
Who's that lounging in my chair
Who's that casting devious stares
In my direction

Yeah Mama this surely is a dream
Yeah Mama this surely is a dream, Dig it
Yeah Mama this surely is a dream
...

### Break  2x

### Chorus  20x (12x + 12x)

I smell sex and candy here
Who's that lounging in my chair?
And who's that casting devious stares
In my direction?

Mama this surely is a dream
Mama this surely is a dream, Dig it
Mama this surely is a dream, yeah
Mama this must be my dream
