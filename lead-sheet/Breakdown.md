# Breakdown

### Intro  8x  

### Vamp  8x

### Verse 1  8x
It's alright if you love me  
It's alright if you don't  
I'm not afraid of you runnin' away honey  
I get the feeling you won't  

### Verse 2  8x
Say there ain't no sense in pretending  
Your eyes give you away  
Something inside you is feeling like I do  
We said all there is to say  

### Chorus  8x
Baby,  
Breakdown, go ahead and give it to me  
Breakdown, honey, take me through the night  
Breakdown, now I'm standin' here, can't you see  
Breakdown, it's alright  
It's alright, it's alright
