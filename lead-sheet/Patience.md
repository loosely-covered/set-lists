# Patience

### Whistle Intro

### Verse  16x
Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you
I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now

Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt
You're in my heart now

### Chorus  16x
Said, woman, take it slow
It'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience

Said, sugar, make it slow
And we come together fine
All we need is just a little patience

### Break  6x
(Patience)

### Verse  16x
I sit here on the stairs
'Cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now
I'll wait, dear

Sometimes I get so tense
But I can't speed up the time
But you know, love
There's one more thing to consider

### Chorus  16x
Said, woman, take it slow
And things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience

Said, sugar, take the time
'Cause the lights are shining bright
You and I've got what it takes
To make it

### Break  6x
we won't fake it,
I'll never break it
'Cause I can't take it

### Guitar Solo  16x

### Break Vamp  6x

### Breakdown  12x

_5th bar_ ( .. Little patience, yeah)
(ooo yeah)
(.. Need a little patience, yeah)
(Just a little patience, yeah)

### Breakdown  12x + 1  
(Some more patience, yeah)
I been walkin' the streets at night
Just tryin' to get it right
(Need some patience, yeah)
Hard to see with so many around
You know I don't like
Being stuck in the crowd

(Could use some patience, yeah)
And the streets don't change
But maybe the name
I ain't got time for the game
(Gotta have some patience, yeah)
'Cause I need you
Yeah, yeah, but I need you

(All it takes is patience)
Oh, I need you
(Just a little patience)
Whoa, I need you
(Is all you need)
All this time
