# Patience

### Guitar Intro  8x

### Verse  16x  
Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you  
.. I'm still alright to smile  
Girl, I think about you every day now  
  
Was a time when I wasn't sure  
.. You set my mind at ease  
There is no doubt you're in my heart now  
  
### Chorus 1  16x  
Said, woman, take it slow  
It'll work itself out fine  
All we need is just a little patience  
  
Said, sugar, make it slow  
And we come together fine  
All we need is just a little patience  
  
### Verse  16x  
I sit here on the stairs  
'Cause I'd rather be alone  
If I can't have you right now  
I'll wait, dear  
  
Sometimes I get so tense  
I can't speed up the time  
But you know, love  
There's one more thing to consider  
  
### Chorus 2  16x  
Said, woman, take it slow  
And things will be just fine  
You and I'll just use a little patience  
  
Said, sugar, take the time  
'Cause the lights are shining bright  
You and I've got what it takes to make it  
  
### Break  6x  
  
### Breakdown  12x + 1    
I been walkin' the streets at night  
Just tryin' to get it right  
Hard to see with so many around  
You know I don't like being stuck in the crowd  
  
And the streets don't change  
But maybe the name  
I ain't got time for the game  
'Cause I need you  
Yeahhhhhh, I need you  
  
### Chorus 2  16x
