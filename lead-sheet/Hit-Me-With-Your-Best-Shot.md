# Hit Me With Your Best Shot

Well you're the real tough cookie with a long history  
Of breaking little hearts, like the one in me  
That's okay let's see how you do it  
Put up your dukes, let's get down to it  
Hit me with your best shot  
Why don't you hit me with your best shot?  
Hit me with your best shot  
Fire away  
You come on with a come on, you don't fight fair  
But that's okay, see if I care  
Knock me down, it's all in vain  
I'll get right back up on my feet again  
Hit me with your best shot  
Why don't you hit me with your best shot?  
Hit me with your best shot  
Fire away  
Well you're a real tough cookie with a long history  
Of breaking little hearts, like the one in me  
Before I put another notch in my lipstick case  
You better make sure you put me in my place  
Hit me with your best shot  
Come on, hit me with your best shot  
Hit me with your best shot  
Fire away  
Hit me with your best shot  
Why don't you hit me with your best shot?  
Hit me with your best shot  
Fire away
