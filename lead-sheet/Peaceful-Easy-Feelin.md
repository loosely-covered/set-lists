# Peaceful Easy Feelin

### Intro  8x  

### Verse 1  16x
I like the way your sparkling earrings lay  
Against your skin so brown  
And I wanna sleep with you in the desert tonight  
With a billion stars all around  

### Chorus  8x
'Cause I got a peaceful easy feeling  
And I know you won't let me down  
'Cause I'm already standing on the ground  

### Verse 2  16x
And I found out a long time ago  
What a woman can do to your soul  
Ah, but she can't take you any way  
You don't already know how to go  

### Chorus  8x
And I got a peaceful, easy feeling  
And I know you won't let me down  
'Cause I'm already standing on the ground  

### Solo  32x

### Verse 3  16x
I get this feeling I may know you  
As a lover and a friend  
But this voice keeps whispering in my other ear  
Tells me I may never see you again  

### Chorus  32x
'Cause I get a peaceful easy feeling  
And I know you won't let me down  
'Cause I'm already standing, I'm already standing  
Yes I'm already standing on the ground
