### Drums/claps  2x

### Verse 1  16x

On the floors of Tokyo yo  
Or down in London town to go, go  
With the record selection  
And the mirror's reflection  
I'm dancing with myself  

When there's no one else in sight  
In the crowded lonely night  
Well I wait so long  
For my love vibration  
And I'm dancing with myself  

### Chorus  8x

Oh oh dancing with myself  
Oh oh dancing with myself  

Well there's nothing to lose  
And there's nothing to prove  
I'll be dancing with myself  
(Oh, oh, oh oh)  

### Verse 2  16x

If I looked all over the world  
And there's every type of girl  
But your empty eyes  
Seem to pass me by  
Leave me dancing with myself  

So let's sink another drink  
'Cause it'll give me time to think  
If I had the chance  
I'd ask the world to dance  
And I'll be dancing with myself  

### Chorus  8x

Oh oh dancing with myself  
Oh oh dancing with myself  

Well there's nothing to lose  
And there's nothing to prove  
I'll be dancing with myself  

Oh, oh uh oh  
Oh, oh uh oh oh  
oh, oh ooooh  
oh, oh uh oooooooooh
