# Dancing With Myself

### Drums/claps  2x

### Intro  8x

### Verse 1  16x
On the floors of Tokyo yo  
Or down in London town to go, go  
With the record selection  
And the mirror's reflection  
I'm dancing with myself  

When there's no one else in sight  
In the crowded lonely night  
Well I wait so long  
For my love vibration  
And I'm dancing with myself  
 
### Chorus  8x
Oh oh 
dancing with myself  
Oh oh  
dancing with myself  

Well there's nothing to lose  
And there's nothing to prove  
I'll be dancing with myself  
(Oh, oh, oh oh)  

### Verse 2  16x
If I looked all over the world  
And there's every type of girl  
But your empty eyes  
Seem to pass me by  
Leave me dancing with myself  

So let's sink another drink  
'Cause it'll give me time to think  
If I had the chance  
I'd ask the world to dance  
And I'll be dancing with myself  

### Chorus  8x
Oh oh  
dancing with myself  
Oh oh  
dancing with myself  
Well there's nothing to lose  
And there's nothing to prove  
I'll be dancing with myself  
Oh, oh uh oh  
Oh, oh uh oh oh  
oh, oh ooooh  
oh, oh uh oooooooooh

If I looked all over the world  
And there's every type of girl  
But your empty eyes  
Seem to pass me by  
Leave me dancing with myself  

So let's sink another drink  
'Cause it'll give me time to think  
If I had the chance (music stop)  
I'd ask the world to dance  
And I'll be dancing with myself  

### Chorus  8x
Oh, oh  
dancing with myself  
Oh, oh  
Oh dancing with myself

If I had the chance  
I'd ask the world to dance  
If I had the chance  
I'd ask the world to dance
