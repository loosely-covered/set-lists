### Verse  6x
And I feel that time's a wasted go  
So where you going 'till tomorrow?  
And I see that these are lies to come  
So would you even care?  

### Prechorus  4x
And I feel it  
And she feels it  

### Chorus  8x
Where you're going for tomorrow?  
Where you're going with that mask I found?  
And I feel, and I feel  
When the dogs begin to smell her  
Will she stand alone?

And I feel, so much depends on the weather 
So is it raining in your bedroom?  
And I see that these are eyes of disarray    
So would you even care?

And I feel it  
And she feels it

When the dogs do find her  
Got time, time to wait for tomorrow  
To find it, to find it, to find it

Got time, time to wait for tomorrow  
To find it, to find it, to find it

To find it, to find it, to find it  
To find it .. To find it .. To find it
