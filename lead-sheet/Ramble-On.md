### Intro  6x

### Verse 1  16x
Leaves are falling all around  
It's time I was on my way  
Thanks to you I'm much obliged  
Such a pleasant stay  

But now it's time for me to go  
The autum moon lights my way.  
and now I smell the rain  
and and with it pain  
and it's headed my way

Ramble on

sing my song

I've been this way 10 years to the day  
I'm gonna ramble on  
I'm gonna find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time for spreadin' roots  
The time has come to be gone  
And to our health
we drank a thousand times

Mine's a the tale that can't be told  
My freedom I hold dear  
How years ago .. In days of old  
The magic filled the air  

Just in the darkest steps of Mordor  
I met a girl so fair  
But Gollum and the Evil one  
crept up and slipped away with her
