Well, I've been haunted in my sleep  
You've been starring in my dreams  
Lord, I miss you child

I've been waiting in the hall  
Been waiting on your call  
When the phone rings  
It's just some friends of mine that say  

"Hey, what's the matter man?  
We're gonna come around at twelve  
With some Puerto Rican girls that's just dyin' to meet you"  

"We're gonna bring a case of wine  
Hey, let's go mess and fool around  
You know, like we used to"

aah Aaah Aaah Ah  
Aaah Ah Ah) (x2)

### Verse  20x
I've been walking Central Park  
Singing after dark  
People think I'm crazy  

Stumbling on my feet  
Shuffling through the street  
People ask me people (Tick tick tick)
"What's the matter with you boy?"  

Sometimes I want to say to myself  
Sometimes I say  

(Oooh oooh oooh ooh  
Oooh oooh oooh ooh  
Oooh ooh ooh) (x2)
I won't miss you child

### Verse  16x
I guess I'm lying to myself  
It's just you and no one else  
Lord, I won't keep you child  

You've been blotting out my mind  
Fooling on my time  
No, I won't miss you, baby, yeah

Lord, I miss you child  
Lord, I miss you child  
Lord, I miss you child
