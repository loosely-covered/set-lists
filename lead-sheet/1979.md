# 1979

### Guitar Vamp  4x  

### Verse 1  14x
..  
Shakedown 1979  
Cool kids never have the time

On a live wire right up off the street  
You and I
should meet

### Verse 2  14x
..  
June bug skipping like a stone  
With the .. headlights pointed at the dawn  
.. We were sure we'd never see
an end .. to it all

### Chorus  14x
And I don't even care  
to shake these zipper blues  
And we don't know  
just where our bones will

rest, To dust I guess  
forgotten and absorbed  
To the earth below  

### Guitar Vamp  4x

### Verse 3  14x
..
Double cross the vacant and the bored  
.. They're not sure just what we have in the store  
Morphine city slippin' dues  
down to see  

### Chorus  12x
We don't even care  
as restless as we are  
We feel the pull  
in the land of a thousand

guilts, And poured cement  
lamented and assured  

### Bridge  14x
To the lights .. and towns below  
Faster than .. the speed of sound  
Faster than .. we thought we'd go  
Beneath the sound .. of hope

### Verse 4  18x
..
Justine never knew the rules  
Hung down with the freaks and .. ghouls

No a..pologies ever need be made  
.. I know you .. better
than you fake it to see  

### Chorus  14x
That we don't even care  
to shake these zipper blues  
And we don't know  
just where our bones will  

rest, To dust I guess  
forgotten and absorbed  
Into the earth below  

### Outro Verse  8x
The street heats the urgency of now  
As you see there's no one around
