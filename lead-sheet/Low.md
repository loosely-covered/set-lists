# Low

Sometimes I wanna take you down  
Sometimes I wanna get you low  
Brush your hair back from your eyes  
Take you down let the river flow  
Sometimes I go and walk the street  
Behind the green sheet of glass  
A million miles below their feet  
A million miles, a million miles  
I'll be with you girl, like being low  
Hey, hey, hey like being stoned  
I'll be with you girl, like being low  
Hey, hey, hey like being stoned  
A million poppies gonna make me sleep  
Just one rose that knows your name  
The fruit is rusting on the vine  
The fruit is calling from the trees  
Hey don't you wanna go down?  
Like some junkie cosmonaut  
A million miles below their feet  
A million miles, a million miles  
I'll be with you girl, like being low  
Hey, hey, hey like being stoned  
I'll be with you girl, like being low  
Hey, hey, hey like being stoned  
Blue, blue is the sun  
Brown, brown is the sky  
Green, green were her eyes  
A million miles, a million miles  
Hey, don't you wanna go down?  
Like some disgraced cosmonaut  
A million miles below their feet  
A million miles, a million miles  
I'll be with you girl, like being low  
Hey, hey, hey like being stoned  
I'll be with you girl, like being low  
Hey, hey, hey like being stoned  
I'll be with you girl, like being low  
Hey, hey, hey like being stoned  
I'll be with you girl, like being low  
Hey, hey, hey like being stoned
