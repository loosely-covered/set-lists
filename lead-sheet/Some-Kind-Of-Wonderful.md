# Some Kind Of Wonderful  

### Intro  4x  
  
### Verse  16x  
  
I don't need a whole lotta money  
I don't need a big, fine car  
I got everything that a girl could want  
I got more than I could ask for  

I don't have to run around  
I don't have to stay out all night  
Cause I got a sweet, sweet lovin man  
And he knows just how to treat me right  

### Pre-chorus  4x  

See, my baby, (he's alright)  
See, my baby, we're so tight  

### Chorus  8x  

Don't you know he is (some kind of wonderful)  
Yes, he is, he's (some kind of wonderful)  
Don't you know he is (some kind of wonderful)  
.. Let me tell you one more thing  

### Verse  16x  

Now, when he holds me in his arms  
He sets my soul on fire  
And, ooh, when my baby kisses me,  
My heart becomes filled with desire  

When he wraps his loving arms around me  
He almost drives me out of my mind  
I get these funny little feelings inside of me (ooo)  
Chills run up and down my spine
