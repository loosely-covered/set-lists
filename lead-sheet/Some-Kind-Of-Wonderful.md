# Some Kind Of Wonderful

I don't need a whole lots of money  
I don't need a big fine car  
I got everything that a man could want  
I got more than I could ask for  
And I don't have to run around  
I don't have to stay out all night  
'Cause I got me a sweet, a sweet loving woman  
And she know just how to treat me right  
Oh, my baby, she's alright  
Oh, my baby's clean out of sight  
Don't you know that she's?  
She's some kind of wonderful  
She's some kind of wonderful  
Yes, she is, she is  
She's some kind of wonderful  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
When I hold her in my arms  
You know she sets my soul on fire  
Oh, when my baby kisses me  
My heart becomes filled with desire  
When she wraps her loving arms around me  
It 'bout drives me out of my mind  
Yeah, when my baby kisses me  
Chills run up and down my spine  
Oh, my baby, she's alright  
Oh, my baby's clean out of sight  
Don't you know that she is?
