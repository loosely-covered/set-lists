### Verse 1  16x
Looking back on when I  
Was a little nappy headed boy  
Then my only worry  
Was for Christmas what would be my toy 

Even though we sometimes  
Would not get a thing  
We were happy with the  
Joy the day would bring  

### Verse 2  16x
Sneaking out the back door  
To hang out with those  
hoodlum friends of mine  
Greeted at the back door  
With boy thought I told you  
not to go outside  
Tryin' your best to bring the  
Water to your eyes  
Thinkin' it might stop her  
From woopin' your behind  

### Chorus  8x
I wish those days ... could ... come back once more  
Why did those days ... ev ...  er have to go  
I wish those days ... could ... come back once more    
Why did those days ... ev ...  er have to go  
Cause I love them so

### Verse 3  16x
Brother says he's tellin'  
'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl  
Just don't tell I'll give you  
Anything you want in this whole wide world  
Mama gives you money 
for Sunday school  
You trade yours for candy
after church is through  

### Verse 4  16x
Smokin' cigarettes and 
writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy)  
Teacher sends you to the 
principal's office down the hall  
You grow up and learn that
kinda thing ain't right  
But while you were doing it
it sure felt outta sight

Why did those days ... ev ...  er have to go  
I wish those days ... could ... come back once more    
Why did those days ... ev ...  er have to go  
Cause I love them so
