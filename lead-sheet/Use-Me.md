# Use Me  

### Intro  8x  

### Verse  24x  

My friends feel it's their appointed duty  
They keep trying to tell me  
All you want to do is use me  
But my answer, yeah to all that use me stuff

I want to spread the news  
That if it feels this good getting used  
You just keep on using me  
Until you use me up

He told me that I ought not to let you just walk on me  
And I'm sure he meant well  
Yeah, but when our talk was through

I said, brother, if you only knew  
You'd wish that you were in my shoes

Until you use me up

### Verse  24x  

Sometimes, it's true  
You really do abuse me
You get me in a crowd of high-class people  
And then you act real rude to me  
But, oh baby, baby, baby, baby,  
When you love me, I can't get enough

Girl, you just keep on using me  
Until you use me up

### Chorus (Intro Vamp)  8x  

Talkin' 'bout you usin' people  
It all depends on what you do  
It ain't too bad the way you're usin' me  
'Cause I sure am usin' you to do the things you do'  

to do the things you do
