# Gone Gone Gone

When life leaves you high and dry  
I'll be at your door tonight  
If you need help, if you need help  
I'll shut down the city lights,  
I'll lie, cheat, I'll beg and bribe  
To make you well, to make you well  
When enemies are at your door  
I'll carry you way from more  
If you need help, if you need help  
Your hope dangling by a string  
I'll share in your suffering  
To make you well, to make you well  
Give me reasons to believe,  
That you would do the same for me  
And I would do it for you, for you  
Baby I'm not moving on  
I love you long after you're gone  
For you, for you  
You would never sleep alone  
I love you long after you're gone  
And long after you're  
Gone, gone, gone  
When you fall like a statue  
I'm gon' be there to catch you  
Put you on your feet, you on your feet  
And if your well is empty  
Not a thing will prevent me  
Tell me what you need,  
What do you need  
I surrender honestly  
You've always done the same for me  
So I would do it for you, for you  
Baby I'm not moving on  
I love you long after you're gone  
For you, for you  
You would never sleep alone  
I love you long after you're gone  
And long after you're  
Gone, gone, gone  
You're my back bone,  
You're my cornerstone  
You're my crutch when my legs stop moving  
You're my headstart,  
You're my rugged heart  
You're the pokes that I've always needed  
Like a drum baby don't stop beating  
Like a drum baby don't stop beating  
Like a drum baby don't stop beating  
Like a drum my heart never stops beating  
For you, for you  
Baby I'm not moving on  
I love you long after you're gone  
For you, for you  
You would never sleep alone  
I love you long after you're gone  
For you, for you  
Baby I'm not moving on  
I love you long after you're gone  
For you, for you  
You would never sleep alone  
I love you long, long after you're gone  
Like a drum baby don't stop beating  
Like a drum baby don't stop beating  
Like a drum baby don't stop beating  
Like a drum my heart never stops beating for you  
And long after you're gone, gone, gone  
I love you long after you're gone gone gone
