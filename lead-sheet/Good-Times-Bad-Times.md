# Good Times Bad Times

Led Zeppelin  
Led Zeppelin  
Good Times Bad Times  
In the days of my youth  
I was told what it means to be a man,  
Now I've reached the age  
I've tried to do all those things the best I can.  
No matter how I try,  
I find my way into the same old jam.  
*Good Times, Bad Times,  
You know I had my share;  
When my woman left home  
For a brown eyed man,  
Well, I still don't seem to care.  
Sixteen: I fell in love  
With a girl as sweet as could be,  
Only took a couple of days  
Till she was rid of me.  
She swore that she would be all mine  
And love me till the end,  
But when I whispered in her ear  
I lost another friend, oooh.  
* Chorus  
I know what it means to be alone,  
I sure do wish I was at home.  
I don't care what the neighbors say,  
I'm gonna love you each and every day.  
You can feel the beat within my heart.  
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part.
