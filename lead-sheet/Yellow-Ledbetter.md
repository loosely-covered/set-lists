# Yellow Ledbetter

Unsealed on a porch, a letter sat  
Then you said, "I wanna leave it again"  
Once I saw her on a beach of weathered sand  
And on the sand I wanna leave it again  
On a weekend I wanna wish it all away, yeah  
And they called and I said that I'll go and I said that I'll call out again  
And the reason ought to leave her calm, I know  
I said, "I don't know whether I'm the boxer or the bag"  
Oh yeah, can you see them, out on the porch?  
Yeah, but they don't wave  
I see them 'round the front way, yeah  
And I know, and I know I don't wanna stay  
Make me cry  
I see, oh, I don't know why there's something else  
I wanna drum it all away  
I said, "I don't, I don't know whether I was the boxer or the bag"  
Oh yeah, can you see them, out the on porch?  
Yeah, but they don't wave  
I see them 'round the front way  
And I know, and I know I don't want to stay at all  
I don't want to stay  
I don't want to stay  
I don't want to stay  
I don't, I don't want to stay
