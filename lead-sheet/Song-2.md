# Song 2

I got my head checked  
By a jumbo jet  
It wasn't easy  
But nothing is, no  
When I feel heavy metal  
And I'm pins and I'm needles  
Well I lie and I'm easy all of the time  
But I'm never sure why I need you  
Pleased to meet you  
I got my head down  
When I was young  
It's not my problem  
It's not my problem  
When I feel heavy metal  
And I'm pins and I'm needles  
Well I lie and I'm easy all of the time  
But I'm never sure why I need you  
Pleased to meet you  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Oh, yeah
