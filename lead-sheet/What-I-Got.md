# What I Got


### Intro  2x

### Verse  16x
Early in the mornin', risin' to the street  
Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet  
Got to find the reason, reason things went wrong  
Got to find the reason why my money's all gone  

I got a Dalmatian, I can still get high  
I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot
...

### Verse  12x
Life is too short, so love the one you got  
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot  
Never startle static I just get it off my chest  
Never had to battle with my bulletproof vest  

Take a small example, take a tip from me  
Take all of your money, give it all to charity  
Life is what I got it's within my reach  
And the sublime style is just straight from long beach  

It all comes back to you, you finally get what you deserve  
Try and test that, you're bound to get served  
Love's what I got, don't start a riot  
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot  

### Chorus  8x
Lovin' is what I got, I said, "Remember that"  
Lovin' is what I got, and remember that  
Lovin' is what I got, I said, "Remember that"  
Lovin' is what I got, I got, I got, I got  

### Bridge  2x
I don't cry when my dog runs away  
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay  

### Verse  4x
I don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot  
Hits the bottle and moves right to the rock  
Fuck it or fight it, it's all the same  
Livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane  

### Break  2x
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me  

### Chorus  8x
