# Cumbersome


### Guitar  8x  

### Verse  16x
She calls me Goliath and I wear the David mask  
I guess the stones are coming too fast for her now  
You know I'd like to believe this nervousness will pass  
All the stones that are thrown are building up a wall  

### Chorus  16x
I have become cumbersome to this world  
I have become cumbersome to my girl  

### Verse  16x
I'd like to believe we could reconcile the past  
Resurrect those bridges with an ancient glance  
But my old stone face can't seem to break her down  
She remembers bridges, burns them to the ground  

### Chorus  16x (double)

### Vamp  16x
Too heavy too light, too black or too white, too wrong or too right  
Today or tonight, cumbersome  
Too rich too poor, she's wanting me less and I'm wanting her more  
The bitter taste is cumbersome  

### Breakdown  ?
No yeah  
No no no yeah  
No no no yeah  
(4 ..)

There is a balance between two worlds  
One with an arrow and a cross  
Regardless of the balance life has become  
Cumbersome  

### Vamp  16x ?  

### Breakdown  ?  
..  
No life has been cumbersome
