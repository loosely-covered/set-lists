### Verse  32x
Very superstitious,  
writings on the wall,  
Very superstitious,  
ladders bout' to fall,  

Thirteen month old baby,  
broke the lookin' glass,  
Seven years of bad luck,  
the good things in your past.  

### Chorus  8x
When you believe in things  
that you don't understand,  
Then we suffer,  
Superstition ain't the way.

### Verse  32x
Very superstitious,  
wash your face and hands,  
Rid me of the problems,  
do all that you can,  

Keep me in a daydream,  
keep me goin' strong,  
You don't want to save me,  
sad is my song.

Very superstitious,  
nothin' more to say,  
Very superstitious,

Thirteen month old baby,

Seven years of bad luck,  
good things in your past.
