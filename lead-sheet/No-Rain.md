# No Rain

All I can say is that my life is pretty plain  
I like watchin' the puddles gather rain  
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two  
And speak my point of view but it's not sane, it's not sane  
I just want someone to say to me  
I'll always be there when you wake  
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today  
So stay with me and I'll have it made  
And I don't understand why I sleep all day  
And I start to complain that there's no rain  
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake  
And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape, escape, escape, escape  
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain  
You don't like my point of view  
You think I'm insane  
It's not sane, it's not sane  
I just want someone to say to me  
I'll always be there when you wake  
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today  
So stay with me and I'll have it made  
And I'll have it made, and I'll have it made, oh no, no  
You know we're really gonna, really gonna have it made, yeah  
We're gonna have it made
