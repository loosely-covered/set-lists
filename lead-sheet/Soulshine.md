# Soulshine

### Intro  8x  

### Verse 1  8x
When you can't find the light  
That got you through the cloudy days  
When the stars ain't shinin' bright  
You feel like you've lost you're way  
When those candle lights of home  
Burn so very far away  
Well you got to let your soul shine  
Just like my daddy used to say.  

### Chorus  8x
He used to say Soulshine  
It's better than sunshine  
It's better than moonshine  
Damn sure better than rain.  
Hey now people don't mind  
We all get this way sometime  
Got to let your soul shine, shine till the break of day.  

### Verse 2  8x
I grew up thinkin' that i had it made  
Gonna make it on my own.  
Life can take the strongest man  
Make him feel so alone.  
Now and then i feel a cold wind  
Blowin' through my achin' bones  
I think back to what my daddy said  
He said "boy, in the darkness before the dawn:"  

### Chorus  8x
Let your soul shine  
It's better than sunshine  
It's better than moonshine  
Damn sure better than rain.  
Yeah now people don't mind  
We all get this way sometimes  
Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day.  

### Breakdown  8x
Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness  
Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul.  
A woman too, god knows, she can feel like this.  
And when your world seems cold,  
you got to let your spirit take control.  

### Solo  16x

### Chorus  8x
Let your soul shine  
It's better than sunshine  
It's better than moonshine  
Damn sure better than rain.  
Lord now people don't mind  
We all get this way sometimes  
Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day.  

### Chorus  8x
Oh, it's better than sunshine  
It's better than moonshine  
Damn sure better than rain.  
Yeah now people don't mind  
We all get this way sometimes  
Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day.
