# Gimme Three Steps

### Intro  9x  

### Intro 2 17x

### Verse 1  17x
I was cutting a rug  
Down at a place called Jug  
With a girl named Linda Lu  
When in walked a man  
With a gun in his hand  
And he was looking for you know who  
He said, "Hey fat fellow  
With the hair colored yellow  
Watcha tryin' to prove?  
'Cause that's my woman there  
And I'm a man who cares  
And this might be all for you"  
... I said, "Excuse me"

### Verse 2  17x
I was scared and fearing for my life  
I was shakin' like a leaf on a tree  
'Cause he was lean, mean  
Big and bad, Lord  
Pointin' that gun at me  
Oh, wait a minute, Mister  
I didn't even kiss her  
Don't want no trouble with you  
And I know you don't owe me  
But I wish you would let me  
Ask one favor from you  

### Chorus  9x
Oh, won't you give me three steps  
Gimme three steps, Mister  
Gimme three steps towards the door  
Gimme three steps  
Gimme three steps, Mister  
And you'll never see me no more, for sure

### Verse 3  17x
Well, the crowd cleared away  
And I began to pray  
And the water fell on the floor  
And I'm telling you son  
Well, it ain't no fun  
Staring straight down a forty four  
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lu  
And that's the break I was looking for  
And you could hear me screaming a mile away  
As I was headed out towards the door  

### Chorus  9x
Oh, won't you give me three steps  
Gimme three steps, Mister  
Gimme three steps towards the door  
Gimme three steps  
Gimme three steps, Mister  
And you'll never see me no more  
Show me the back door
