### Verse  8x  
  
When you grab a hold of me  
You tell me that I'll never be set free  
But I'm a parasite  
Creep and crawl, I step into the night

Two pints of booze  
You tell me are you a badfish too?  
(Are you a badfish too?)  
  
### Chorus  8x  
  
Ain't got no money to spend  
I hope the night would never end  
Lord knows I'm weak  
Won't somebody get me off of this reef?  
  
### Verse  8x  
  
Baby, you're a big blue whale  
Grab the reef when all duck divin' fails  
I swim, but I wish I'd never learned  
The water's too polluted with germs  
  
### Verse  4x  
  
I dive deep when it's ten feet over head  
Grab the reef underneath my bed  
(underneath my bed)

Ain't got no quarrels with God  
Ain't got no time .. to grow old  
Lord knows I'm weak  
Won't somebody get me off of this reef?
