# Let Me Put My Love Into You  {short="Let Me Put ... You"}  

Flying on a free flight  
Driving all night  
With my machinery  
'Cause I got the power  
Any hour  
To show the man in me  
I got reputations  
Blown to pieces  
With my artillery  
I'll be guided in  
We'll be ridin'  
given what you got to me  
  
Don't you struggle  
Don't you fight  
Don't you worry  
'Cause it's your turn tonight  
  
CHORUS:  
Let me put my love into you, babe  
Let me put my love on the line  
Let me put my love into you, babe  
Let me cut your cake with my knife  
  
Like a fever  
Burning faster  
You spark the fire in me  
Crazy feelings  
Got me reeling  
They got me raising steam  
  
Don't you struggle  
Don't you fight  
Don't you worry  
'Cause it's your turn tonight  
  
CHORUS  
  
Let me give it all to you
