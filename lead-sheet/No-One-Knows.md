# No One Knows

We get some rules to follow  
That and this  
These and those  
No one knows  
We get these pills to swallow  
How they stick in your throat?  
Taste like gold  
Oh what you do to me  
No one knows  
And I realize you're mine  
Indeed a fool am I  
And I realize you're mine  
Indeed a fool am I  
And I journey through the desert  
Of the mind  
With no hope  
I follow  
Well I drift along the ocean  
Dead lifeboats  
In the sun  
Come undone  
Pleasantly caving in  
I come undone  
And I realize you're mine  
Indeed a fool am I  
And I realize you're mine  
Indeed a fool am I  
Heaven smiles above me  
What a gift  
Here below  
But no one knows  
Gift that you give to me  
No one know
