# Vasoline

One time a thing occurred to me  
What's real and what's for sale?  
Blew a kiss and tried to take it home  
Isn't you, isn't me  
Search for things that you can't see  
Goin' blind, out of reach  
Somewhere in the vasoline  
Two times and it has rendered me  
Punched, drunk and without bail  
Think I'd be safer all alone  
Flies in the vasoline, we are  
Sometimes it blows my mind  
Keep gettin' stuck here all the time  
Isn't you, isn't me  
Search for things that you can't see  
Goin' blind, out of reach  
Somewhere in the vasoline  
You'll see the look and you'll see the lies  
You'll eat the lies and you will  
Flies in the vasoline, we are  
Sometimes it blows my mind  
Keep gettin' stuck here all the time  
Isn't you, isn't me  
Search for things that you can't see  
Goin' blind, out of reach  
Somewhere in the vasoline
