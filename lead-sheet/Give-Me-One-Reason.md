# Give Me One Reason

Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Said, I don't wanna leave you lonely  
You got to make me change my mind  
Baby, I got your number  
And I know that you got mine  
You know that I called you  
I called too many times  
You can call me, baby  
You can call me anytime  
You got to call me  
Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Said, I don't wanna leave you lonely  
You got to make me change my mind  
I don't want no one to squeeze me  
They might take away my life  
I don't want no one to squeeze me  
They might take away my life  
I just want someone to hold me  
And rock me through the night  
This youthful heart can love you, yes  
And give you what you need  
I said, This youthful heart can love you  
And give you what you need  
But I'm too old to go chasing you around  
Wasting my precious energy  
Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Give me one reason to stay here  
I'll turn right back around  
Said, I don't wanna leave you lonely  
You got to make me change my mind  
Baby just give me one reason  
Give me just one reason why  
Baby just give me one reason  
Give me just one reason why I should stay  
Said, I told you that I loved you  
And there ain't no more to say
