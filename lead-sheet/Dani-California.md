# Dani California

Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi  
Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie  
In Alabama she was swinging hammer  
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama  
She never knew that there was anything more than poor  
What in the world does your company take me for?  
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana  
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana  
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner  
On her merry way saying baby what you gonna  
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45  
Just another way to survive  
California rest in peace  
Simultaneous release  
California show your teeth  
She's my priestess, I'm your priest  
Yeah, yeah  
She's a lover, baby and a fighter  
Should've seen her coming when it got a little brighter  
With a name like Dani California  
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya  
A little loaded she was stealing another breath  
I love my baby to death  
California rest in peace  
Simultaneous release  
California show your teeth  
She's my priestess, I'm your priest  
Yeah, yeah  
Who knew the other side of you?  
Who knew what others died to prove?  
Too true to say goodbye to you  
Too true, too sad sad sad  
Push the fader, gifted animator  
One for the now and eleven for the later  
Never made it up to Minnesota  
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota  
Down in the badlands she was saving the best for last  
It only hurts when I laugh  
Gone too fast  
California rest in peace  
Simultaneous release  
California show your teeth  
She's my priestess, I'm your priest  
Yeah, yeah  
California rest in peace  
Simultaneous release  
California show your teeth  
She's my priestess, I'm your priest  
Yeah, yeah
