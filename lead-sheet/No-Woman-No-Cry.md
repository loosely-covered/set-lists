# No, Woman, No Cry

### Intro  16x

No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

### Verse  16x
'Cause—'cause—'cause I remember when a we used to sit
In a government yard in Trenchtown,
Ob—observing the hypocrites
Yeah!
Mingle with the good people we meet.
Yeah!

Good friends we have. Oh.
Good friends we have lost along the way. Yeah!
In this great future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say
Yeah

### Chorus  8x
No, woman, no cry.
No, woman, no cry. Eh, yeah!
A little darlin', don't shed no tears.
No, woman, no cry. Eh!

### Verse  16x
Said—said, said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire lights,
As it was, log wood burnin' through the nights

Then we would cook cornmeal porridge,
of which I'll share with you.
My feet is my only carriage
And so I've got to push on through

### Bridge  8x
But while I'm gone,
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right, yeah!
Everything's gonna be all right!

Everything's gonna be all right a!
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right, yeah!
Everything's gonna be all right!

### Chorus  8x
So, no, woman, no cry.
No, woman, no cry.
I say, oh, little—oh, little darlin', don't shed no tears.
No, woman, no cry. Eh.

### Chorus  8x
No, woman—no, woman—no, woman, no cry.
No, woman, no cry.
One more time I got to say,
Oh, little little darlin', please don't shed no tears.
No, woman, no cry.
