# I Want You Back


### Intro  12x
Uh huh huh huhhh  
Let me tell ya now (AHUH AHUH AHUH)  
Uh huh (Mmhhmmm)

### Verse  8x
Let me tell you now  
When I had you to myself  
I didn't want you around  
Those pretty faces always made you  
Stand out in a crowd  

But someone picked you from the bunch  
One glance was all it took  
Now it's much too late for me  
To (take a second look)  

### Chorus  8x
Oh baby, give me one more chance  
(To show you that i love you)  
Won't you please let me  
Back in your heart  

Oh darling, I was blind to let you go 
(Let you go, baby)  
But now since I see you in his arms  
(I want you back)

### Break  3x+2
Yes I do now (I want you back)   
Ooh, ooh baby (I want you back)    
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back)  
Na na na na  

### Verse  8x
Trying to live without your love  
Is one long sleepless night  
Let me show you, girl  
That I know wrong from right  

Every street you walk on (oo ooo)  
I leave tear stains on the ground  
Following the girl  
I didn't (even want around)
