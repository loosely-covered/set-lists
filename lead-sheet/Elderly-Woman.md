# Elderly Woman

### Verse  16x
I seem to recognize your face  
Haunting, familiar, yet  
I can't seem to place it  

Cannot find the candle of thought  
to light your name  
Lifetimes are catching up  
with me ..

### Prechorus  8x
All these changes taking place  
I wish I'd seen the place,  
but no one's ever taken me  

### Chorus  8x
Hearts and thoughts they fade,  
fade away  
Hearts and thoughts they fade,  
fade away  

### Verse  8x
I swear I recognize your breath  
Memories like fingerprints   
are slowly raising  

Me you wouldn't recall,  
for I'm not my former  
It's hard when  
you're stuck upon the shelf  

### Prechorus  16x ?
I changed by not changing at all,  
small town predicts my fate  
Perhaps that's what no one wants to see  

I just wanna scream helloooo  
My god, it's been so long,  
never dreamed you'd return  

But now here you are,  
and here I am  
Hearts and thoughts, they fade .. away

### Chorus  8x  

### Chorus  8x  

### Chorus  8x +  
..  
Hearts and thoughts, they fade
