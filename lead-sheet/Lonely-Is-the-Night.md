# Lonely Is the Night

Lonely is the night when you find yourself alone  
Your demons come to light and your mind is not your own  
Lonely is the night when there's no one left to call  
You feel the time is right, say the writin's on the wall  
It's a high time to fight when the walls are closin' in  
Call it what you like it's time you got to win  
Lonely, lonely, lonely your spirit's sinkin' down  
You find you're not the only stranger in this town  
Red lights, green lights, stop and go jive  
Headlines, deadlines jammin' your mind  
You been stealin' shots from the side  
Let your feelin's go for a ride  
There's danger out tonight, the man is on the prowl  
Get the dynamite, the boys are set to howl  
Lonely is the night when you hear the voices call  
Are you ready for a fight, do you wanna take it all?  
Slowdown, showdown waitin' on line  
Show time, no time for changin' your mind  
Streets are ringin', march to the sound  
Let your secrets follow you down  
Somebody's watchin' you baby, so much you can do  
Nobody's stoppin' you baby, from makin' it too  
One glimpse'll show you now baby, what the music can do  
One kiss'll show you now baby, it can happen to you  
No more sleepin', wastin' our time  
Midnight creepin's, first on our minds  
No more lazin' 'round the TV  
You'll go crazy, come out with me  
Feelin' lonely  
Lonely is the night  
Feelin' lonely  
Lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely, lonely
