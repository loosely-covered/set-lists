# All Summer Long


### Drum flams  1x

### Piano Intro  8x

### Verse 1  8x
It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan

### Chorus Vamp  4x
Ahh Ahh Ahh x2

### Verse 2  8x
Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

### Chorus  8x
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

### Sweet Home Vamp  4x
...
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

### Verse 3  8x
Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

### Chorus  8x
While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Oh yeah

### Verse 4  8x
Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again
