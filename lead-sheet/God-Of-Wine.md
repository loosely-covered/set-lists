### Intro  8x  
  
### Verse  16x  
  
Every thought that I repent  
There's another chip you haven't spent  
And you're cashing them all in  
Where do we begin to get clean again  
Can we get clean again  
  
I walk home alone with you  
In the mood you're born into  
Sometimes you let me in  
And I take it on the chin  
I can't get clean again  
I want to know, can we get clean again  
  
### Verse  16x  
  
The God of Wine comes crashing through  
The headlights of a car that took you farther  
Than you thought you'd ever want to go  
We can't get back again ...  
We can't get back again ...  
  
She takes a drink and then she waits  
The alcohol it permeates  
And soon the cells give way,  
and cancels out the day  
  
### Guitar Solo  8x  
  
### Breakdown  16x  
  
I can't keep it all together ...  
I know I know I know I know I know  
I can't keep it all together  
...  
  
And the siren's song that is your madness  
Holds a truth I can't erase  
All alone on your face  
...

### Verse  16x  
  
Every glamorous sunrise  
Throws the planets out of line  
A star sign out of whack, a fraudulent zodiac  
  
And the God of Wine is crouched down in my room  
You let me down, I said it, now I'm going down  
And you're not even around  
And I said no no no no no no no no  
...  
  
### Breakdown  16x  
  
I can't keep it all together  
I know I know I know I know I know  
I can't keep it all together  
...  
  
And there's a memory of a window, Looking through I see you  
Searching for something I could never give you  
There's someone who understands You more than I do  
A sadness I can't erase, All alone on your face
