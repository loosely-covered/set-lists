# Black Hole Sun

### Intro  7x  

### Verse  16x + 4 ?
In my eyes, indisposed  
In disguise as no one knows  
Hides the face, lies the snake  
The sun in my disgrace  

Boiling heat, summer stench  
'Neath the black, the sky looks dead  
Call my name through the cream  
And I'll hear you scream again  

### Chorus  8x + 4 ?
Black hole sun, won't you come?  
And wash away the rain  
Black hole sun, won't you come?  
Won't you come?  

### Verse  16x + 4 ?
Stuttering, cold and damp  
Steal the warm wind, tired friend  
Times are gone for honest men  
And sometimes far too long for snakes  

In my shoes, a walking sleep  
And my youth, I pray to keep  
Heaven send Hell away  
No one sings like you anymore
