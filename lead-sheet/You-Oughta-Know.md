# You Oughta Know


### Quiet Intro  8x
I want you to know that I'm happy for you  
I wish nothing but the best for you both  

### Verse 1  8x
An older version of me, is she perverted like me?  
Would she go down on you in a theater?  
Does she speak eloquently and would she have your baby?  
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother  

### Pre chorus  8x
'Cause the love that you gave that we made  
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no  
And every time you speak her name  
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died, 'til you died But you're still alive  

### Chorus  8x + 4
And I'm here to remind you  
Of the mess you left when you went away  
It's not fair to deny me  
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me  
You, you, you oughta know  

### Verse 2  16x
You seem very well, things look peaceful  
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know  

Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity?  
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner  
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced  
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her?  

### Pre chorus  8x
'Cause the love that you gave that we made  
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no  
And every time you speak her name  
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me Until you died, 'til you died?  
But you're still alive  

### Chorus  8x + 4
And I'm here to remind you  
Of the mess you left when you went away  
It's not fair to deny me  
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me  
You, you, you oughta know  

### Guitar/Vox Breakdown  16x

### Pre chorus  8x
'Cause the joke that you made in the bed that was me  
And I'm not gonna fade  
As soon as you close your eyes, and you know it  
And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back I hope you feel it
Can you feel it?  

### Chorus  8x + 4
Well I'm here to remind you  
Of the mess you left when you went away  
It's not fair to deny me  
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me  
You, you, you oughta know  

### Chorus  8x + 4
Why I'm here to remind you  
Of the mess you left when you went away  
It's not fair to deny me  
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me  
You, you, you oughta know
