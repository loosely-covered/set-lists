# When I Come Around

Oh I heard you cryin' loud  
All the way across town  
You've been searching for that someone  
And it's me out on the prowl  
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself  
Well don't get lonely now  
And dry your whining eyes  
I'm just roaming for the moment  
Sleazing my backyard so don't get so uptight  
You've been thinking about ditching me  
No time to search the world around  
'Cause you know where I'll be found  
When I come around  
Oh I heard it all before  
So don't knock down my door  
I'm a loser and the user  
So I don't need no accuser  
To try and slag me down because I know you're right  
So it go, do what you like  
Make sure you do it wise  
You may find out that yourself doubt  
Means nothing was ever there  
You can't come forcing somethin' if it's just not right  
No time to search the world around  
'Cause you know where I'll be found  
When I come around  
No time to search the world around  
'Cause you know where I'll be found  
When I come around  
Oh, when I come around  
Oh, when I come around  
When I come around
