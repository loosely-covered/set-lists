# Wagon Wheel

Headin' down south to the land of the pines  
I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline  
Starin' up the road and pray to God I see headlights  
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours  
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers  
And I'm a hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight  
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel  
Rock me mama any way you feel  
Hey... mama rock me  
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain  
Rock me mama like a south bound train  
Hey... mama rock me  
Runnin' from the cold up in New England  
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band  
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now  
Oh, north country winters keep a getting me down  
I lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town  
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more  
So, rock me mamma like a wagon wheel  
Rock me mama any way you feel  
Hey... momma rock me  
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain  
Rock me mama like a south bound train  
Hey... mama rock me  
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke  
I caught a trucker out of Philly, had a nice long toke  
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap  
To Johnson City, Tennessee  
And I gotta get a move on before the sun  
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one  
And if I died in Raleigh at least I will die free  
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel  
Rock me mama any way you feel  
Hey... mama rock me  
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain  
Rock me mama like a south bound train  
Hey... mama rock me  
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel  
Rock me mama any way you feel  
Hey... mama rock me  
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain  
Rock me mama like a south bound train  
Hey... mama rock me
