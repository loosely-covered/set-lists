# Like A Stone

On a cobweb afternoon  
in a room full of emptiness  
by a freeway i confess  
i was lost in the pages  
of a book full of death  
reading how we'll die alone  
and if we're good we'll lay to rest  
anywhere we want to go  
in your house i long to be  
room by room patiently  
i'll wait for you there  
like a stone i'll wait for you there  
alone  
on my deathbed i will pray  
to the gods and the angels  
like a pagan to anyone  
who will take me to heaven  
to a place i recall  
i was there so long ago  
the sky was bruised  
the wine was bled  
and there you led me on  
in your house i long to be  
room by room patiently  
i'll wait for you there  
like a stone i'll wait for you there  
alone  
and on i read  
until the day was gone  
and i sat in regret  
of all the things i've done  
for all that i've blessed  
and all that i've wronged  
in dreams until my death  
i will wander on
