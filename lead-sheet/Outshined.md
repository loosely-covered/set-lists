# Outshined

I got up feeling so down  
I got off being sold out  
I've kept the movie rolling  
But the story's getting old now  
I just looked in the mirror  
And things aren't looking so good  
I'm looking California  
And feeling Minnesota  
So now you know  
  (Who gets mystified)  
So now you know  
  (Who gets mystified)  
Show me the power child, I'd like to say  
That I'm down on my knees today  
It gives me the butterflies, gives me away  
'Til I'm up on my feet again  
I'm feeling, I'm feeling  
Outshined, outshined, outshined, outshined  
Someone let the dogs out  
They'll show you where the truth is  
The grass is always greener  
Where the dogs are shedding  
I'm feeling that I'm sober  
Even though I'm drinking  
I can't get any lower  
Still I feel I'm sinking  
So now you know  
  (Who gets mystified)  
So now you know  
  (Who gets mystified)  
Show me the power child, I'd like to say  
That I'm down on my knees today  
It gives me the butterflies, gives me away  
'Til I'm up on my feet again  
I'm feeling, I'm feeling  
Outshined, outshined, outshined, outshined  
Outshined  
So now you know  
  (Who gets mystified)  
Show me the power child, I'd like to say  
That I'm down on my knees today  
It gives me the butterflies, gives me away  
'Til I'm up on my feet again  
I'm feeling, I'm feeling  
Show me the power child, I'd like to say  
That I'm down on my knees today  
It gives me the butterflies, gives me away  
'Til I'm up on my feet again  
I'm feeling, I'm feeling  
Outshined, outshined, outshined, outshined
