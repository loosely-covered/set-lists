# Panama

Jump back, what's that sound?  
Now, here she comes, foot tap an' top down  
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue  
Model citizen, zero discipline  
Don't ya know she's comin' home with me?  
You'll lose her in that turn  
I'll get her, her an' her  
Panama, Panama  
Panama, Panama  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Ain't nothin' like it, her shiny machine  
She got a feel for the road, keep the movin' parts clean  
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue  
An' got a freeway comin' through my bedroom  
Don't you know she's comin' home with me?  
You'll lose her in that turn  
I'll get her and her and her and her  
Panama, Panama  
Panama, ooh, Panama  
Oh, oh, oh, ah ooh  
Now, I'm flyin' an' she's flyin'  
She's right behind in the rear view mirror  
Got the foot in, power steerin'  
Pistons poppin', ain't no stoppin', now  
Panama, Panama  
Panama, Panama  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Panama, Panama  
Panama, Panama  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Panama
