# Creep


### Intro  8x  

### Verse  16x
When you were here before  
Couldn't look you in the eye  
You're just like an angel  
Your skin makes me cry  

You float like a feather  
In a beautiful world  
I wish I was special  
You're so fucking special  

### Chorus  8x
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo  
What the hell am I doing here?  
I don't belong here  

### Verse  16x
I don't care if it hurts  
I want to have control  
I want a perfect body  
I want a perfect soul  

I want you to notice  
When I'm not around  
You're so fucking special  
I wish I was special  

### Chorus  8x
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo  
What the hell am I doing here?  
I don't belong here  

### Chorus  16x
She's running out the door  
She's running  
She run, run, run, run  
Run  ...

### Verse  16x (quiet)
Whatever makes you happy  
Whatever you want  
You're so fucking special  
I wish I was special  

### Chorus  8x (retards)
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo  
What the hell am I doing here?  
I don't belong here  
I don't belong here
