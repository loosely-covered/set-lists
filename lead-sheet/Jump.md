# Jump

### Intro  16x

I get up and nothin' gets me down  
You got it tough, well, I've seen the toughest around  

And I know, baby, just how you feel  
You got to roll with the punches to get to what's real  

### Pre chorus  8x+1x

Ah, can't ya see me standin' here?  
I got my ass against the record machine  
I ain't the worst that you've seen  
Ah, can't ya see what I mean?

### Chorus  8x

I might as well jump (Jump!)  
Might was well jump  
Go ahead and jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump.

### Verse  8x

Aaa ohh Hey you! Who said that?  
Baby how you been?  
You say you don't know, you won't know  
Until you begin.
