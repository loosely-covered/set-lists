# Blue Monday

How does it feel to treat me like you do  
When you've laid your hands upon me and told me who you are  
I thought I was mistaken , I thought I heard your words  
Tell me  how do I feel tell me now? How do I feel?  
How does it feel?  
How should I feel?  
Tell me how does it feel?  
To treat me like you do  
Those who came before me lived through their vocations  
From the past until completion they'll turn away no more  
And I still find it so hard to say what I need to say  
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me just how I should feel today  
I see ship in the harbor, I can and shall obey  
But if it wasn't for your misfortunes I'd be a heavenly person today  
And I thought I was mistaken and I thought I heard you speak  
Tell me now how should I feel?  
Now I stand here waiting  
I thought I told you to leave me  
While I walked down to the beach  
Tell me how does it feel when your heart grows cold  
How does it feel?  
How should I feel?  
Tell me how does it feel?  
To treat me like you do
