# Loosely Covered - Lead Sheets

The `lead-sheet` folder contains all of the "lead sheets" (lyrics, plus structure) for the songs in our repertoire.  **Don't forget** to leave a blank line at the end of every lead sheet!

## Create a New Lead Sheet

For a new Lead Sheet, you should create a **new file** specific to that song using the following instructions:

1. Open a browser tab to your favorite lyrics site (e.g., azlyrics.com, songlyrics.com); search for the lyrics to the new song; and copy the song lyrics.
2. In a separate browser tab, open this `set-lists` repo and click on the `lead-sheet` folder.
3. Then, click the "Add file" dropdown button, followed by the "Create new file" button.
4. In the "Name Your File ..." field, name the new Lead Sheet for that song as "Song-Name.md" (e.g., "Back-In-Black.md").  Each word should start with a capital letter, and replace all special characters (e.g. "-", "'", "&") with a dash.
5. At a minimum, on the first line of the "Edit new file" section, type the pound sign, a space, the Song Name, then a new line.
6. Then, paste the lyrics into the "Edit new file" section, and add song structure, if desired.
7. **Don't forget** to leave a blank line at the end of every lead sheet.
8. Click the green "Commit new file" button at the bottom of the page to save.
9. The new lead sheet now will appear in the `lead-sheet` folder of the repo.

## Editing and Improving Lead Sheets

All lead sheets are basically plain text.  The only requirements are having:

- the "#" symbol, followed by a space and the Song Name, on the first line;
- then a blank line;
- then the lyrics;
- then a blank line at the end.

However, a Lead Sheet is more useful with a little structure.  Take a look at the top of the Lead Sheet for [Rebel Yell](./Rebel-Yell.md).

```
# Rebel Yell


### Intro  _B-D-C_

### Verse  16x  _B-G-A_
Last night a little dancer
came dancing to my door
Last night a little angel
came pumping on the floor

She said, come on baby
You got a license for love
And if it expires
pray help from above, because
```

The following structure has been added to the plain-text lyrics:

- Section headings, like "Intro" and "Verse", have been added using the "### " symbols.  These break the song up into its major parts.
- You  can add the number of bars in each section (e.g., "16x").
- You can add blank lines to separate the different parts of each section.
- You also can add the chords for that section in italics; just put an underscore on either side of the chord progression.
- You can separate out the harmony lyrics by putting them in parentheses.

To add this kind of structure to a Lead Sheet, do the following:

1. Click on the name of the Lead Sheet in the `lead-sheet` folder of the repo.
2. Find the "pencil" icon ("Edit this file") on the right side of the page above the lyrics.
3. Make the desired changes to the structure of the song.
5. Click the green "Commit changes" button at the bottom of the page to save.
6. The edited lead sheet now will appear in the `lead-sheet` folder of the repo.
