# Bang a Gong Get It On {short="Bang a Gong"}  

Well you're dirty and sweet, clad in black  
don't look back and I love you  
you're dirty and sweet, oh yeah  
well you're slim and you're weak  
you've got the teeth of a hydra upon you  
you're dirty sweet and you're my girl.  
get it on, bang the gong, get it on  
get it on, bang the gong, get it on  
You're built like a car, you've got a hub cap diamond star halo  
you're built like a car, oh yeah  
you're an untamed youth that's the truth with your cloak full of eagles  
you're dirty sweet and you're my girl.  
get it on, bang the gong, get it on  
get it on, bang the gong, get it on  
You're windy and wild, you've got the blues in your shoes and your  
stockings  
you're windy and wild, oh yeah  
you're built like a car, you've got a hub cap diamond star halo  
you're dirty sweet and you're my girl.  
get it on, bang the gong, get it on  
get it on, bang the gong, get it on  
You're dirty and sweet, clad in black, don't look back  
and i love you  
you're dirty and sweet, oh yeah  
you dance when you walk so let's dance, take a chance, understand me  
you're dirty sweet and you're my girl.  
get it on, bang the gong, get it on  
get it on, bang the gong, get it on
