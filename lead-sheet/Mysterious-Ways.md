# Mysterious Ways

Johnny take a walk with your sister the moon  
Let her pale light in to fill up your room  
You've been living underground, eating from a can  
You've been running away from what you don't understand  
Love  
She's slippy  
You're sliding down  
She'll be there  
When you hit the ground  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right  
She moves in mysterious ways  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right  
She moves in mysterious ways  
Johnny take a dive with your sister in the rain  
Let her talk about the things you can't explain  
To touch is to heal, to hurt is to steal  
If you want to kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel  
On your knees boy  
She's the wave  
She turns the tide  
[Incomprehensible]  
She knows why  
It's all right, it's all right, all right  
She moves in mysterious ways  
It's all right, it's all right, all right  
She moves in mysterious ways  
It's all right, it's all right, all right  
Lift my days, light up my nights, love  
One day you will look back  
And you'll see where you were held how  
By this love while you could stand there  
You could move on this moment, follow this feeling  
It's all right, it's all right, all right  
She moves in mysterious ways  
It's all right, it's all right, all right  
She moves in mysterious ways  
Oh love, oh love  
Love, no, no, no  
Move you, spirit move, move  
Move you, move with it  
She moves with it  
Lift my days, light up my nights, love
