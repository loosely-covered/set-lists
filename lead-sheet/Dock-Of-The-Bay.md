# Dock of the Bay


### Intro  4x  

### Verse  8x
Sittin' in the morning sun
I'll be sittin' when the evening comes
Watching the ships roll in
Then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah

### Chorus  8x
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay wastin' time

### Verse  8x
I left my home in Georgia, headed for the Frisco bay
'Cos I've had nothing to live for
And look like nothing's gonna come my way

### Chorus  8x
So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay wastin' time

### Breakdown  8x
Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, listen

### Verse  8x
Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, listen
2000 miles I've roamed
Just to make this dock my home

### Chorus  8x
Now I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay wastin' time

### Whistle Chorus Out  8x
