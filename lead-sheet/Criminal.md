Criminal  
I've been a bad bad girl  
I've been careless with a delicate man  
And its a sad sad world  
When a girl will break a boy  
Just because she can  
Don't you tell me to deny it  
I've done wrong and I want to  
Suffer for my sins  
I've come to you 'cause I need  
Guidance to be ture  
And I just don't know where I can begin  
What I need is a good defense  
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal  
And I need to redeemed  
To the one I've sinned against  
Because he's all I ever knew of love  
Heaven help me for the way I am  
Save me from these evil deeds   
Before I get them done  
I know tomorrow brings the consequence  
At hand  
But I keep livin' this day like  
The next will never come  
Oh help me but don't tell me  
To deny it  
I've got to cleanse myself  
Of all these lies till I'm good  
Enough for him  
I've got a lot to lose and I'm  
Bettin' high  
So I'm beggin' you before it ends  
Just tell me where to begin  
What I need is a good defense  
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal  
And I need to redeemed  
To the one I've sinned against  
Because he's all I ever knew of love  
Let me know the way  
Before there's hell to pay  
Give me room to lay the law and let me go  
I've got to make a play  
To make my lover stay  
So what would an angel say   
The devil wants to know  
What I need is a good defense  
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal  
And I need to redeemed  
To the one I've sinned against  
Because he's all I ever knew of love  
What I need is a good defense  
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal  
And I need to redeemed  
To the one I've sinned against  
Because he's all I ever knew of love
