# Sweet Emotion

(Groovy Instrumental Intro)  
Sweet Emotion  
Sweet Emotion  
You talk about things that nobody cares  
You're wearing out things that nobody wears  
You're calling my name but I gotta make clear  
I can't say baby where I'll be in a year  
(Guitar Riff)  
When some Sweat Hot mama with a face like a gent  
Said my get up and go musta got up and went  
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar  
'Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire  
(Guitar Riff)  
Sweet Emotion  
Sweet Emotion  
When I pulled into town in a police car  
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far  
You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied  
You can't catch me 'cause the rabbit done died  
Yes it did  
(Guitar Riff)  
You stand in the front just a shakin' your ass  
I'll take you backstage, you can drink from my glass  
I'll talk about something you're sure to understand  
'Cause a month on the road an' I'll be eating from your hand  
(Guitar Riff)
