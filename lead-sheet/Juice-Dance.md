### Juice Intro  8x  
  
### Juice Verse  8x  
  
Mirror, mirror on the wall  
Don't say it 'cause I know I'm cute (Ooh, baby)  
Louis down to my drawers  
LV all on my shoes (Ooh, baby)  

I be drippin' so much sauce  
Gotta been looking like RAGÃš (Ooh, baby)  
Lit up like a crystal ball  
That's cool, baby, so is you  
(That's how I roll)  

### Juice Prechorus  8x  

If I'm shinin', everybody gonna shine (Yeah, I'm gold)  
I was born like this, don't even gotta try (Now you know)  

I'm like chardonnay, get better over time (So you know)  
Heard you say I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie (Haha)  

### Juice Chorus  16x  
  
(It ain't my fault) that I'm out here gettin' loose  
Gotta blame it on the Goose  
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby  

(It ain't my fault) that I'm out here makin' news  
I'm the pudding in the proof  
Gotta blame it on my juice  

(Ya-ya-ee ... ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya)  
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice

### Juice Verse  8x  

No, I'm not a snack at all  
Look, baby, I'm the whole damn meal (Ooh, baby)  
David, you ain't bein' slick  
Don't dare try to cop a feel (Ooh, baby)  

The juice ain't worth the squeeze  
If the juice don't look like this (Like this, like this)  
Hold up, nigga, please  
Don't make me have to take your bitch, shit (How I roll)

### Dance Verse  16x  

(Let's dance)  
Put on your red shoes, And dance the blues  
(Let's dance)  
To the song they're playin' on the radio  

(Let's sway)  
While color lights up your face  
(Let's sway)  
Sway through the crowd to an empty space  
  
### Dance Chorus  16x  

If you say run, I'll run with you  
If you say hide, we'll (hide ahh ahh ahh ahh)  

Because my love for you  
Would break my heart in two  

If you should fall into my arms  
And tremble like a ...
