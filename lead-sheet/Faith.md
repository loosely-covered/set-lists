# Faith


### Intro  2x  

### Verse  8x
Well I guess it would be nice  
If I could touch your body  
I know not everybody  
Has got a body like you  

But I've got to think twice  
Before I give my heart away  
And I know all the games you play  
Because I play them too  

### Pre chorus  8x
Oh but I  
Need some time off  
From that emotion  
Time to pick my heart up off the floor

Oh, and that love comes down  
Without devotion  
Well it takes a strong man baby  
But I'm showing you the door  

### Chorus  4x
Because I gotta have faith  
I gotta have faith  
Because I got to have faith, faith  
I gotta have faith, faith, faith  

### Verse  8x
Baby  
I know you're asking me to stay  
Sayin' please, please, please, don't go away  
You say I'm giving you the blues  

Maybe  
You mean every word you say  
Can't help but think of yesterday  
And another who tied me down to lover boy rules  

### Pre chorus  8x
Before this river  
Becomes an ocean  
Before you throw my heart back  
On the floor  

Oh, baby I reconsider  
My foolish notion  
Well I need someone to hold me  
But I'll wait for something more
