# Guitars and Cadillacs  
  
### Intro  
  
### Verse  16x  

Girl you taught me how to hurt real bad and cry myself to sleep  
And showed me how this town can shatter dreams  
  
Another lesson 'bout a naive fool who came to Babylon  
And found out that the pie don't taste so sweet  
  
### Chorus  16x  

Now it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music  
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home  
  
Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music  
It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on  
  
### Guitar-Violin Break  16x  
  
### Verse  16x  

Ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives  
Painful scars are all that's left of me  
Oh, but thank you girl for teachin' me brand new ways to be cruel  
If I can find my mind now I guess I'll just leave  
  
### Chorus  16x

### Chorus  16x  

Oh it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music  
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
