# This Is How You Remind Me {short="This ... Remind Me"}  

Never made it as a wise man  
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealin'  
Tired of livin' like a blind man  
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feelin'  
And this is how you remind me  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
It's not like you to say sorry  
I was waiting on a different story  
This time I'm mistaken  
For handing you a heart worth breakin'  
And I've been wrong, I've been down  
Been to the bottom of every bottle  
These five words in my head  
Scream, "Are we having fun yet?"  
Yet, yet, yet, no no  
Yet, yet, yet, no no  
It's not like you didn't know that  
I said, "I love you", and I swear I still do  
It must have been so bad  
'Cause living with me must have  
Damn, near killed you  
And this is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
It's not like you to say sorry  
I was waiting on a different story  
This time I'm mistaken  
For handing you a heart worth breakin'  
And I've been wrong, I've been down  
Been to the bottom of every bottle  
These five words in my head  
Scream, "Are we having fun yet?"  
Yet, yet, yet, no no  
Yet, yet, yet, no no  
Yet, yet, yet, no no  
Yet, yet, yet, no no  
Never made it as a wise man  
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing  
And this is how you remind me  
This is how you remind me  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
It's not like you to say sorry  
I was waiting on a different story  
This time I'm mistaken  
For handing you a heart worth breakin'  
And I've been wrong, I've been down  
Been to the bottom of every bottle  
These five words in my head  
Scream, "Are we having fun yet?"  
Yet, yet, "Are we having fun yet?"  
Yet, yet, "Are we having fun yet?"  
Yet, yet, "Are we having fun yet?"  
  (Five words in my head)  
Yet, yet, [Incomprehensible]  
  (Five words in my head)
