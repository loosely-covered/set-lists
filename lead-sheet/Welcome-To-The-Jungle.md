# Welcome To The Jungle {short="Welcome 2 Jungle"}  

Oh, my God  
Welcome to the jungle, we got fun 'n games  
We got everything you want, honey, we know the names  
We are the people that can find whatever you may need  
If you got the money, honey, we got your disease  
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to your shun na, na, na  
Knees, knees, I, I wanna watch you bleed  
Welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day  
If you want, you're gonna bleed but it's the price you pay  
And you're a very sexy girl, very hard to please  
You can taste the bright lights but you won't get there for free  
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle  
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine  
I, I wanna hear you scream  
Welcome to the jungle, it gets worse here everyday  
You learn to live like an animal in the jungle, where we play  
If you got a hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually  
You can have anything you want but you better not take it from me  
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to your shun na, na, na  
Knees, knees, I'm gonna watch you bleed  
And when you're high, you never, ever want to come down  
So down, so down, so down, yeah  
You know where you are?  
You're in the jungle, baby, you gonna die  
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to your shun na, na, na  
Knees, knees, in the jungle, welcome to the jungle  
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine  
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to your shun na, na, na  
Knees, knees, down in the jungle, welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to your, it's gonna bring you down
