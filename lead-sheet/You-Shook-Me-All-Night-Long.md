### Intro  8x

### Guitar  8x

### Verse  16x

She was a fast machine  
She kept her motor clean  
She was the best damn woman I had ever seen  

She had the sightless eyes  
Telling me no lies  
Knockin' me out with those American thighs  

Taking more than her share  
Had me fighting for air  
She told me to come but I was already there  

'Cause the walls start shaking  
The earth was quaking  
My mind was aching  
And we were making it, and you ..

### Chorus  8x

Shook me all night long  
Yeah you shook me all night long  

### Verse  16x

Working double time  
On the seduction line  
She was one of a kind, she's just mine all mine  

She wanted no applause  
Just another course  
Made a meal out of me and came back for more  

Had to cool me down  
To take another round  
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing  

'Cause the walls were shaking  
The earth was quaking  
My mind was aching  
And we were making it and you ..
