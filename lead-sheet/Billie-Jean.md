# Billie Jean  

### Intro  12x  

### Verse  12x  

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene  
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one  
Who will dance on the floor in the round  
She said I am the one  
who will dance on the floor in the round  

### Verse  8x  

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene  
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one  
Who will dance on the floor in the round  
  
### Prechorus  8x  

People always told me be careful of what you do  
And don't go around breaking young girls hearts  
And mother always told me be careful of who you love  
And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth  
  
### Chorus  12x  

Billie Jean is not my lover  
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one  
But the kid is not my son  
She says I am the one  
but the kid is not my son  
  
### Verse  12x  

For forty days and for forty nights  
I was on her side  
But who can stand when she's in demand  
Her schemes and plans  
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round  
So take my strong advice  
just remember to always think twice  

### Verse  8x  
  
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me  
Then showed a photo, my baby cried, his eyes were like mine (oh, no)  
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby  

### Prechorus  8x  
  
People always told me be careful of what you do  
And don't go around breaking young girls hearts  
She came and stood right by me, justthe smell of sweet perfume  
This happened much too soon, she called me to her room
