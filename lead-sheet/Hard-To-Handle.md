# Hard To Handle


### Intro  5x

### Verse  8x
Baby, here I am  
I'm the man on the scene  
I can give you what you want

I have got some good old lovin'  
And I got some more in store  
When I get through throwin' it on you  
You gotta' come back for more  

### Chorus 1  4x
Boys and things that come by the dozen  
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'  
Hey little thing, let me light your candle  
'Cause Mama, I'm sure hard to handle  
Now gets around

### Verse  8x
Action speaks louder than words  
And I'm a man of great experience  
I know you've got another man  
But I can love you better than him  

Take my hand don't be afraid  
I'm gonna prove every word I say  
I'm advertising love for free  
So you can place your ad with me
