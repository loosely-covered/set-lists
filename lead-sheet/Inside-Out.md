# Inside Out

I would swallow my pride I would choke on the  
Rhines. But the lack thereof would leave me  
Empty inside I would swallow my doubt turn it  
Inside out find nothing but faith in nothing  
Want to put my tender heart it in a blender  
Watch it spin round to a beautiful oblivion  
Rendezvous then I'm through with you  
I burn burn like a wicker cabinet chalk white and oh so frail I see out time has gotten stale. The t  
Tock of the clock is painful. All sane and logical  
I want to tear it off the wall I hear words and clips  
And phrases I think sick like ginger ale. My stomach  
Turns and I exhale  
I would swallow my pride I would choke on the  
Rhines. But the lack thereof would leave me  
Empty inside I would swallow my doubt turn it  
Inside out find nothing but faith in nothing  
Want to put my tender heart it in a blender  
Watch it spin round to a beautiful oblivion  
Rendezvous then I'm through with you  
So Cal is where my mind  
States but it's not my state of mind I'm not as  
Ugly sad as you. Or am I origami folded up and  
Just pretend demented as the motives in your  
Head  
I would swallow my pride I would choke on the  
Rhines. But the lack thereof would leave me  
Empty inside I would swallow my doubt turn it  
Inside out find nothing but faith in nothing  
Want to put my tender heart it in a blender  
Watch it spin round to a beautiful oblivion  
Rendezvous then I'm through with you  
I alone am the one you don't know you  
Need me take heed feed your ego. Make me blind  
When your eyes close sink when you get close  
Tie me to the bedpost  
I would swallow my pride I would choke on the  
Rhines. But the lack thereof would leave me  
Empty inside I would swallow my doubt turn it  
Inside out find nothing but faith in nothing  
Want to put my tender heart it in a blender  
Watch it spin round to a beautiful oblivion  
Rendezvous then I'm through with you
