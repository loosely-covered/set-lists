# Inside Out

  
### Chorus  16x  

I would swallow my pride, I would choke on the rinds  
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside  
Swallow my doubt, turn it inside out  
find nothing but faith in nothing  

Want to put my tender heart in a blender  
Watch it spin around to a beautiful oblivion  
Rendezvous then I'm through with you  
..

### Verse  24x  

Burn burn like a wicker cabinet  
chalk white and oh so frail  
I see out time has gotten stale  

The tic-tock of the clock is painful  
All sane and logical  
I want to tear it off the wall  

I hear words and clips  
And phrases I think sick like ginger ale  
My stomach turns and I exhale  

### Chorus  16x  

### Verse  16x 
So Cal is where my mind states  
but it's not my state of mind  
I'm not as ugly sad as you.  

Or am I origami  
folded up and just pretend  
demented as the motives  
in your head  

### Chorus  16x  

### Bridge  24x  
..

I alone am the one you don't know  
you need to keep feed your ego  
Make me blind when your eyes close  
sink when you get close, tie me to the bedpost  

I alone am the one you don't know  
you need, you don't know you need me  
Make me blind when your eyes close  
.. tie me to the bedpost  

### Chorus  16x
