# Fuck You

### Intro  4x  

### Chorus  16x  

I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love  
and I'm like, "Fuck you!"  
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough  
I'm like, "Fuck you and fuck her too."  
  
I said, "If I was richer, I'd still be with ya."  
Ha, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)  
And although there's pain in my chest  
I still wish you the best, with a "Fuck you!"  
  
### Verse  16x  

I'm sorry; Can't afford a Ferrari,  
But that don't mean I can't get you there.  
I guess he's an Xbox, and I'm more Atari,  
But the way you play your game ain't fair.  
  
I pity the fooool that falls in love with you  
(Oh shit she's a golddigger)  
Well (Just thought you should know nigga)  
Ooooo I've got some news for you.  
Yeah go run and tell your little boyfriend.  
  
### Chorus  16x  
  
### Verse  16x  

Now I know; That I had to borrow,  
Beg and steal and lie and cheat.  
Trying to keep ya; Trying to please ya.  
'Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap.  
  
Now I pity the foool that falls in love with you  
(Oh shit she's a golddigger)  
Well (Just thought you should know nigga)  
Oooo I've got some news for you.  
Oooo, I really hate your ass right now.

### Breakdown  16x  

Now baby, baby, baby, why d'you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?  
(So bad, so bad, so bad)  
I tried to tell my mama but she told me,  "This is one for your dad."  
(Your dad, your dad, your dad) yes she did
