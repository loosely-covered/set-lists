# Livin After Midnight

Livin' after midnight, rockin' to the dawn  
Lovin' till the mornin', then I'm gone, I'm gone  
I took the city 'bout one a.m.  
Loaded, loaded  
I'm all geared up to score again  
Loaded, loaded  
I come alive in the neon light  
That's when I make my moves right  
Livin' after midnight, rockin' to the dawn  
Lovin' till the mornin', then I'm gone, I'm gone  
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel  
Loaded, loaded  
Ready to take on every deal  
Loaded, loaded  
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take  
But this motor's revved up, fit to break  
Livin' after midnight, rockin' to the dawn  
Lovin' till the mornin', then I'm gone, I'm gone  
I'm aiming for ya  
I'm gonna floor ya  
My body's comin'  
All night long  
The air's electric, sparkin' power  
Loaded, loaded  
I'm getting hotter by the hour  
Loaded, loaded  
I set my sights and then home in  
The joint starts flying when I begin  
Livin' after midnight, rockin' to the dawn  
Lovin' till the mornin', then I'm gone, I'm gone  
Livin' after midnight, rockin' to the dawn  
Lovin' till the mornin', then I'm gone, I'm gone  
Livin' after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
