# Margaritaville

### Intro  8x  

### Verse 1  16x
Nibblin' on sponge cake   
Watchin' the sun bake   
All of those tourists covered with oil   
Strummin' my six string   
On my front porch swing   
Smell those shrimp they're beginnin' to boil   

### Chorus  16x   
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville   
Searching for my lost shaker of salt   
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame   
But I know it's nobody's fault   

### Verse 2  16x
I don't know the reason   
I stayed here all season   
Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo   
But it's a real beauty   
A Mexican cutie   
How it got here I haven't a clue   

### Chorus  16x  
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville   
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt   
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame   
Now I think   
Hell, it could be my fault   

### Solo  16x  

### Verse 3  16x
I blew out my flip flop   
Stepped on a pop top   
Cut my heel had to cruise on back home   
But there's booze in the blender   
And soon it will render   
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on   

### Chorus  16x 
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville   
Searching for my lost shaker of salt   
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame   
But I know it's my own damn fault   

### Chorus  9+x 
Yes and some people claim that there's a woman to blame   
And I know it's my own damn fault
