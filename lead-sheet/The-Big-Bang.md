# The Big Bang

### Intro  4x
.. 
Oh, babe  

### Verse  8x
I don't wanna lie  
I'm gonna take what you're giving  
'Cause I know you're willing  
To take me all the way  

You got me right here  
Impossible  
And I can't wait to finally explode  

### Chorus  8x
The Big, Big Bang  
The reason I'm alive  
When all the stars collide  
In this universe inside  

The big, big bang  
The big, big bang  
The big, big bang  

### Verse  8x
Some people like to talk  
But I'm into doing  
What I feel like doing  
When I'm inspired to  

If we take a walk down  
the beach tonight  
I bet that we could light up the sky  

### Chorus  8x
The Big, Big Bang  
The reason I'm alive  
When all the stars collide  
In this universe inside  

The big, big bang  
The big, big bang  
The big, big bang  

### Bridge  10x
.. Take it for me, I don't wanna be mummified  
Sometimes I feel so isolated  
I wanna die 
and I'll take it from you if you got it every time  
So baby, bring your body here, next to mine  
Next to mine  
Next to mine when I don't wanna dance  

### Verse  4x
I just wanna live it  
So baby, let's not miss this thing  

### Chorus  8x
The Big, Big Bang  
The reason I'm alive  
When all the stars collide  
In this universe inside  

The big, big bang  
The big, big bang  
The big, big bang
