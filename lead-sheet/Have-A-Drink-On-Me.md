# Have A Drink On

Whiskey, gin and brandy  
With a glass I'm pretty handy  
I'm trying to walk a straight line  
On sour mash and cheap wine  
So join me for a drink boys  
We're gonna make a big noise  
So don't worry about tomorrow  
Take it today  
Forget about the cheque  
We'll get hell to pay  
Have a drink on me  
Dizzy, drunk and fightin'  
On tequila white lightnin'  
My glass is getting shorter  
On whiskey, ice and water  
So come on and have a good time  
And get blinded out of your mind  
So don't worry about tomorrow  
Take it today  
Forget about the cheque  
We'll get hell to pay  
Have a drink on me  
(Get stoned)  
Gonna roll around  
Gonna hit the ground  
Take another swing  
Have another drink  
Gonna drink it dry  
Gonna get me high  
Come on all the boys  
Make a noise  
Have a drink on
