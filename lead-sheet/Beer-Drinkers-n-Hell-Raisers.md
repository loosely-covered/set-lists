# Beer Drinkers n Hell Raisers

If you see me walkin' down the line
With my fav'rite honky tonk in mind
Well, I'll be here around supper time
With my can of dinner and a bunch of fine

Beer drinkers, hell raisers, yeah
Uh huh huh, baby, don't you wanna come with me?

The crowd gets loud when the band gets right
Steel guitar cryin' through the night
Yeah, try'n to cover up the corner fight
But ev'rything's cool 'cause they's just tight

Beer drinkers, hell raisers, yeah
Huh, baby, don't you wanna come with me?
Ah, play it boy

The joint was jumpin' like a cat on hot tin
Lord, I thought the floor was gonna give in
Soundin' a lot like a house congressional
'Cause we're experimental and professional

Beer drinkers, hell raisers, yeah
Well, baby, don't you wanna come with me?
