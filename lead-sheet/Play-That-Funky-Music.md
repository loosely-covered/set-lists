# Play That Funky Music


### Intro  4x
.. Hey; do it to me now  
Yeah hey  

### Verse  16x
Hey once I was a boogie singer  
playin' in a rock and roll band  
I never had no problems (yeah)  
burnin' down one night stands  

And everything around me (yeah)  
Got to stop to feelin' so low  
And I decided quickly .. yes I did  
To disco down and check out the show  

### Pre chorus  4x
Yeah they was dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'  
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted  

### Chorus  12x
Play that funky music white boy  
Play that funky music right  
Play that funky music white boy  
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die  
Till you die (yeah)  

### Verse  16x
Well I tried to understand this (yeah)  
hey, I thought that they were out of their minds   
How could I be so foolish? (How could I?)  
To not see I was the one behind  

But still I kept on fighting  
Well, losin' every step of the way  (what you do?)  
I said I must go back there (I got to go back)  
And check to see if things still the same  

### Pre chorus  4x

### Solo  8x

### Verse  16x
Hey wait a minute  
Now first it wasn't easy  
changin' rock and roll and minds  
And things were gettin' shaky (yeah)  
I thought I'd have to leave it behind  

Oh but now it's so much better (it's so much better)   
I'm funkin' out in every way  
But I'll never lose that feelin' (no I won't)  
Of how I learned my lesson that day
