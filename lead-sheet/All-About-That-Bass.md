# All About That Bass


### Chorus  8x (claps)
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass... bass... bass... bass

### Verse  8x
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places

### Verse  8x
I see the magazine workin' that Photoshop
We know that shit ain't real, come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty, beauty, just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

### Prechorus  16x
Yeah, my mama she told me "don't worry about your size"
(Shoo wop wop, sha ooh wop wop)
She says, "Boys like a little more booty to hold at night"
(That booty booty, uh, that booty booty)
You know I won't be no stick figure silicone Barbie doll
(Shoo wop wop, sha ooh wop wop)
So if that what you're into, then go 'head and move along

### Chorus  8x
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass... Hey!

### Verse  8x
I'm bringing booty back
Go 'head and tell them skinny bitches that
No, I'm just playing, I know you think you're fat
But I'm here to tell you...
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

### Prechorus  16x
Yeah my mama she told me, "don't worry about your size"
(Shoo wop wop, sha ooh wop wop)
She says, "Boys like a little more booty to hold at night"
(That booty booty, uh, that booty booty)
You know I won't be no stick figure, silicone Barbie doll
(Shoo wop wop, sha ooh wop wop)
So if that's what you're into, then go 'head and move along
