### Verse 1  8x
I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind  
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time  
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon  
And I feel there is nothing I can do, oh yeah  

### Groove  4x

### Verse 2  8x
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon  
After all I knew it had to be something to do with you  
I really don't mind what happens now and then  
As long as you'll be my friend at the end  

### Chorus  8x
If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?  
If I'm alive and well, will you be there a holding my hand?  
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might  
Kryptonite  
No no no no no no no

### Verse 3  8x
You called me strong, you called me weak, but still your secrets I will keep  
You took for granted all the times I never let you down  
You stumbled in and bumped your head, if not for me then you'd be dead  
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground  

### Chorus  8x
If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?  
If I'm alive and well, will you be there a holding my hand?  
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might

No no no no no no no, no no no no no no no
