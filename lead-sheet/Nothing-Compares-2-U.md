# Nothing Compares 2 U    

### Intro  8x  
  
### Verse  16x  

It's been seven hours and fifteen days  
Since you took your love away  
I go out all night and sleep all day  
Since you took your love away  
  
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want  
I can see who ever I choose  
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant  
But nothing nothing can take away these blues  
  
### Chorus  4x  

Cause nothing compares  
Nothing compares .. to you  
  
### Verse  16x  

It's been so lonely without you here  
Like a bird without a song  
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling  
Tell me .. where did I go wrong  
  
I could put my arms around any girl I choose  
But it just reminds me of you  
I went to the doctor and guess what it told me  
Said boy, u betta try to have fun no matter what u do  
But he's a fool  
  
### Chorus  4x

### Verse  8x  

All the flowers that you planted, mama  
In your back yard  
All died when you went away  
And I know living with me baby is sometimes hard  
But I'm willing .. to give it another try  
  
### Chorus  8x  
 .. to you
