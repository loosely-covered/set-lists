# Where the Streets Have No Names {short="Where the Streets"}  

### (lots of stuff)  

### Verse 1  12x

I wanna run  
I want to hide  
I want to tear down the walls  
that hold me inside  
I want to reach out  
and touch the flame

### Guitar Vamp  4x

Where the streets have no name

### Verse 2  12x

I want to feel  
sunlight on my face  
I see the dust cloud disappear  
without a trace  
I want to take shelter  
from the poison rain  

### Guitar Vamp  4x

Where the streets have no name  
Oh hoh

### Chorus  12x

Where the streets have no name  
Where the streets have no name  
We're still building and  
burning down love  
Burning down love  
And when I go there  
I go there with you  
It's all I can do  

### Guitar Vamp  4x

### Verse 3  12x

The city's a flood  
and our love turns to rust  
We're beaten and
blown by the wind  
trampled in dust  
I'll show you a place  
high on a desert plain  

### Guitar Vamp  4x

Where the streets have no name  
Ah hah

Where the streets have no name  
Where the streets have no name

burning down love  
Burning down love  
And when I go there  
I go there with you  
It's alllll I can do  

### Chorus (outro vamp)  20x

Our love turns to rust  
We're beaten and  
blown by the wind  
blown by the wind  
Oh, we're still in dust  
See our love turn to rust  
I'll be beaten and  
blown by the wind  
blown by the wind  
And when I go there  
I go there with you  
It's all I can do
