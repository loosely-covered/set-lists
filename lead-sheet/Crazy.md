# Crazy

### Intro  4x  

### Verse  16x  

(ooooo)  
I remember when,  
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind  
There was something so pleasant about that place.  
Even your emotions had an echo  
In so much space  
  
(mmmm oooo)  
And when you're out there  
Without care,  
Yeah, I was out of touch  
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough  
I just knew too much  
  
### Chorus  8x  

(ahhh)  
Does that make me crazy?  
Does that make me crazy?  
Does that make me crazy?  
Possibly  
  
### Verse  16x  

(ahhh ooo ooo)  
And I hope that you are having the time of your life  
But think twice, that's my only advice  
  
(oh ooo ooo)  
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are,  
Ha ha ha bless your soul  
You really think you're in control  

### Chorus  8x  

(ahhh)  
Well, I think you're crazy  
I think you're crazy  
I think you're crazy  
Just like me  
  
### Verse  16x  

(ooooo)  
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb  
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them  

(oh ooo ooo)  
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun  
And it's no coincidence I've come  
And I can die when I'm done  

### Chorus  8x  
  
(ahhh)  
Maybe I'm crazy  
Maybe you're crazy  
Maybe we're crazy  
Probably  
  
### Chorus Instrumental  8x  

Uh, uh
