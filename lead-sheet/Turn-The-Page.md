### Sax Intro  6x  

### Verse 1  16x
On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha  
You can listen to the engine rolling out his one note song  
You can think about the woman  
Or the girl you knew the night before  

But your thoughts will soon be wanderin' the way they always do  
When your riding sixteen hours and there's nothin much to do  
And you don't feel much like riding  
You just wish the trip was through  

### Chorus  8x
Say here I am on the road again  
There I am up on the stage  
Here I go playin' the star again  
There I go

### Piano Break  2x

### Verse 2  16x
Well you walk into a restaurant strung out from the road  
And you feel the eyes upon you as you're shakin' off the cold  
You pretend it doesn't bother you  
But you just want to explode  
Most times you can't hear 'em talk other times you can  
All the same ol' cliches, is that a woman or a man  
And you always seem outnumbered  
You don't dare make a stand  

### Chorus  8x
Here I am on the road again  
There I am up on the stage  
Here I go playin' the star again  
There I go

### Violin Break  4x

### Verse 3  16x
Out there in the spotlight your a million miles away  
Every ounce of energy you try to give away  
As the sweat pours out your body  
Like the music that you play  (sax riff, then quiet)
Later in the evening as you lie awake in bed  
With the echoes from the amplifiers ringin' in your head  
You smoke the day's last cigarette  
Remembering what she said  

### Piano Break  2x

### Chorus  8x
Ah here I am on the road again  
There I am up on the stage  
Here I go playin' the star again  
There I go  
Turn the page  

### Big Chorus  8x
Ah here I am on the road again  
There I am up on the stage  
Here I go playin the star again  
There I go there I go

### Sax Outro  6x
