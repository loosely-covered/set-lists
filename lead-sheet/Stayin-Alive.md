# Stayin Alive

### Intro  Drums 2x

### Verse  4x
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk,   
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk.    
Music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around   
since I was born.    

### Pre chorus  4x
And now it's all right.  It's OK.    
And you may look the other way.    
We can try to understand   
the New York Times' effect on man.  

### Chorus  8x
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother,   
you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.    
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin',   
and we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.  

Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.  
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive.  

### Verse  4x
Well now, I get low and I get high,   
and if I can't get either, I really try.  
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes.    
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose.    

### Pre chorus  8x
You know it's all right.  It's OK.    
I'll live to see another day.    
We can try to understand   
the New York Times' effect on man.    

### Chorus  8x
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother,   
you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.    
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin',   
and we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.    
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.  
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive.
