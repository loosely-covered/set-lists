# Black

### Intro  8x 

Hey...oooh...  

### Verse  16x 
Sheets of empty canvas,  
untouched sheets of clay  
laid spread out before me  
as her body once did.  

Alllll five horizons revolved around her soul  
As the earth to the sun  
Now the air I tasted and breathed  
hassss taken a turn  

### Prechorus  16x ?
Ooh, and all I taught her was .. everything  
Ooh, how quick the sun can .. drop awayyyy  

And now my bitter hands .. cradle broken glass  
Of what was everything?  
Oh, the pictures have .. all been washed in black,  
tattooed everything...  

### Verse  8x 
I take a walk outside  
I'm surrounded by some kids at play  
I can feel their laughter,  
ooo, so why do I sear  

### Prechorus  32x ?
Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin .. round my head  
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning  
How quick the sun can .. drop away  

And now my bitter hands .. cradle broken glass  
Of what was everything?  
All the pictures have .. all been washed in black,  
tattooed everything...  
All the love gone bad .. turned my world to black  
Tattooed all I see, all that I am,  
all I'll be...yeah...  

Uh huh...uh huh...ooh...  

### Prechorus  8x 
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life,  
I know you'll be a star  
In somebody else's sky, but why  
Why, whyyyy can't it be,  
can't it be mine...  

### Outro  32x
