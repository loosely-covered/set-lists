# Outside

And you  
You bring me to my knees, again  
And all the times  
Then I could beg you please, in vain  
All the times  
Then I felt insecure, for you  
And I leave  
My burdens at the door  
But I'm on the outside  
I'm looking in  
I can see through you  
See your true colors  
'Cause inside you're ugly  
You're ugly like me  
And I can see through you  
See to the real you  
All the times  
That I felt like this won't end, it's for you  
And I taste  
What I could never have, it was from you  
All the times  
That I've cried my intentions, full of pride  
But I waste  
More time than anyone  
But I'm on the outside  
I'm looking in  
I can see through you  
See your true colors  
'Cause inside you're ugly  
You're ugly like me  
I can see through you  
See to the real you  
And all the times  
That I've cried, all this wasted, it's all inside  
And I feel  
All this pain, stuffed it down, it's back again  
And I lie  
Here in bed all alone  
I can't mend  
But I feel tomorrow will be okay  
But I'm on the outside  
And I'm looking in  
I can see through you  
See your true colors  
'Cause inside you're ugly  
You're ugly like me  
I can see through you  
See to the real you
