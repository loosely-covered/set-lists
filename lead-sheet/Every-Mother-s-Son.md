# Every Mother s Son

### Intro  8x  

### Verse 1  16x
Well, I've been ridin' a winning horse for a long, long time  
And sometimes I wonder, is this the end of the line  

No one should take advantage of who they are  
No man has got it made if he thinks he does, he's wrong  

### Chorus  8x
Every mother's son  
Better hear what I say  
Every mother's son  
Will rise and fall someday  

### Guitar Break  4x 

### Verse 2  16x
I've seen it happen so many times, so many times before  
Some man's got so much money, he doesn't worry no more  

Or he's got such a pretty woman that'll treat him fine  
Well, my friend has been a fool, it happens every time  

### Chorus  8x
Every mother's son  
Better hear what I say  
Every mother's son  
Will rise and fall someday  

### Verse 3  16x
I'm not tryin' to preach to no one, to no one at all  
I've seen so many of my good friends just rise to fall  
'Cause they got so much money or a woman so fine  
Well, my friends have all been fools, it happens every time  

### Chorus  8x
Every mother's son  
Better hear what I say  
Every mother's son  
Will rise and fall someday  
What I say  

### Chorus  8x
Every mother's son  
Better hear what I say  
Every mother's son  
Will rise and fall someday  
What I say  

### Chorus  8x
Oh, every mother's son  
Will rise and fall someday  
Every mother's, every mother's son
