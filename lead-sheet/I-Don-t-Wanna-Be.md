# I Don t Wanna Be

I don't need to be anything other than a prison guards son  
I don't need to be anything other than a specialist's son  
I don't have to be anyone other than a birth of two souls in one  
Part of where I'm going is knowing where I'm coming from  
I don't wanna be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately  
All I have to do is think of me and I've peace of mind  
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms wondering what I gotta do  
Or who I'm supposed to be, I don't wanna be anything other than me  
I'm surrounded by liars everywhere I turn  
I'm surrounded by impostors everywhere I turn  
I'm surrounded by identity crisis everywhere I turn  
Am I the only one to notice? I can't be the only one who's learned  
I don't wanna be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately  
All I have to do is think of me and I've peace of mind  
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms wondering what I gotta do  
Or who I'm supposed to be, I don't wanna be anything other than me  
Can I have everyone's attention please?  
If you're not like this and that, you're gonna have to leave  
I came from the mountain, the crust of creation  
My whole situation made from clay to stone and now I'm telling everybody  
I don't wanna be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately  
All I have to do is think of me and I've peace of mind  
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms wondering what I gotta to do  
Or who I'm supposed to be, I don't wanna be anything other than me  
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, no  
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be anything  
Anything other than me  
I don't wanna be  
I don't wanna be  
I don't wanna be
