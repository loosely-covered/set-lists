# Little Lover

Saw you in the front row
Moving to the beat
(just movin' and groovin')
Killed me when i saw
The wet patch on your seat
(wasn't coca cola)
Oh baby
I hope you liked the show
When the band said good night
I had to say hello

Chorus:
Little lover, i can't get you off my mind (no)
Little lover, i've been trying hard to find
Someone like you

Oh baby
You sure looked sweet
(cruisin')
A leg either side
Of my motorcycle seat
(just oozin')
Could have been a nightmare
Could have been a dream
But on my way home, baby
I thought i heard you scream

Little lover, i can't get you off my mind
Little lover, i've been trying hard to find
Someone to give me the things that i need, ow!

You had my picture
On your bedroom wall
(next to gary glitter)
I was standing on the stage
Playing rock 'n' roll
(i was a guitar picker)
Never had a record
Never had a hit
Oh baby
You didn't mind a bit

Chorus

Baby i know you're a  
Little lover
