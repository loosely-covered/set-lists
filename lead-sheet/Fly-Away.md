# Fly Away

I wish that I could fly  
Into the sky  
So very high  
Just like a dragonfly  
I'd fly above the trees  
Over the seas  
In all degrees  
To anywhere I please  
Oh, I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yea, yea, yea  
I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yea, yea, yea  
Let's go and see the stars  
The Milky Way or even Mars  
Where it could just be ours  
Let's fade into the sun  
Let your spirit fly  
Where we are one  
Just for a little fun  
Oh, oh, oh yea  
I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yea, yea, yea  
I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yea, yea, yea  
I got to get away  
Girl I got to get away  
Oh, oh, oh yea  
I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yea, yea, yea  
   (With you )  
Oh yeah  
I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yea, yea, yea  
   (With you )  
I got to get away  
I want to get away  
I want to get away  
I want to get away  
I want to get away  
Yea  
I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yea, yea, yea  
   (With you )  
Girl I got to get away  
I want to get away  
I want to get away  
I want to get away  
I want to get away  
Yea  
I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yea, yea, yea  
   (With you )  
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
