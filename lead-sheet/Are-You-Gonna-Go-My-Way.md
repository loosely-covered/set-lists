### Verse 1  16x

I was born long ago  
I am the chosen, I'm the one  
I have come to save the day  
And I won't leave until I'm done  

So, that's why you've got to try  
You got to breath and have some fun  
Though I'm not paid, I play this game  
And I won't stop until I'm done  

### Chorus  2x+4x

(But what I really want to know is)
Are you gonna go my way ?  
(Please baby) And I got to  
(please) Got to know  

### Verse 2  16x

I don't know why we always cry  
This we must leave and get undone  
We must engage and rearrange  
And turn this planet back to one  

So, tell me why we got to die  
And kill each other one by one  
We've got to hurt and rub a dub  
We've got to dance and be in love
