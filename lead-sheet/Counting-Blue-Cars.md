# Counting Blue Cars

Must of been mid afternoon  
I could tell by how far  
The child's shadow stretched out and  
He walked with a purpose  
In his sneakers, down the street  
He had many questions  
Like children often do, he said  
"Tell me all your thoughts on God"  
"Tell me am I very far?"  
Must of been late afternoon  
On our way the sun broke free of the clouds  
We count only blue cars  
Skip the cracks, in the street  
And ask many questions  
Like children often do, we said  
"Tell me all your thoughts on God  
'Cause I would really like to meet her  
And ask her why we're who we are"  
"Tell me all your thoughts on God  
'Cause I am on my way to see her  
So tell me am I very far  
Am I very far now?"  
It's getting cold picked up the pace  
How our shoes make hard noises in this place  
Our clothes are stained  
We pass many cross eyed people  
And ask many questions  
Like children often do  
"Tell me all your thoughts on God  
'Cause I would really like to meet her  
And ask her why we're who we are"  
"Tell me all your thoughts on God  
'Cause I am on my way to see her  
So tell me am I very far?"  
Am I very far now?  
Am I very far now?  
Am I very far now?  
"Tell me all your thoughts on God"  
"Tell me all your thoughts on God"
