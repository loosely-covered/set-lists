# Vertigo

Unos, dos, tres, catorce!  
Lights go down it's dark  
The jungle is your head  
Can't rule your heart  
A feeling so much  
Stronger than a thought  
Your eyes are wide and though  
Your soul it can't be bought  
Your mind can wander  
Hello hello  
(Hola)  
I'm at a place called Vertigo  
(Donde esta?)  
It's everything I wish I didn't know  
Except you give me something  
I can feel, feel  
The night is full of holes  
As bullets rip the sky  
Of ink with gold  
They twinkle as the  
Boys play rock and roll  
They know that they can't dance  
At least they know  
I can't stand the beats  
I'm asking for the cheque  
The girl with crimson nails  
Has Jesus 'round her neck  
Swinging to the music  
Swinging to the music  
Hello hello  
(Hola)  
I'm at a place called Vertigo  
(Donde esta?)  
It's everything I wish I didn't know  
But you give me something  
I can feel, feel  
All of this, all of this can be yours  
All of this, all of this can be yours  
All of this, all of this can be yours  
Just give me what I want  
And no one gets hurt  
Hello hello  
(Hola)  
We're at a place called Vertigo  
(Donde esta?)  
Lights go down and all I know  
Is that you give me something  
I can feel your love teaching me how  
Your love is teaching me how  
How to kneel, kneel  
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea  
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
