# Cold Hard Bitch

Gotta leave town  
Got another appointment  
Spent all my rent  
Girl you know I enjoyed it, yeah  
Ain't gonna hang around  
Till there's nobody dancing  
I don't wanna hold hands  
And talk about our little plans, alright  
Cold hard bitch just a kiss on the lips  
Then I was on my knees, I'm waitin', give me  
Cold hard bitch she was shakin' her hips  
So that was all that I needed  
Gonna check her out  
She's my latest attraction  
Gonna hang around  
Wanna get a reaction, yeah  
Gonna take her home  
'Cause she's over romancing  
Don't wanna hold hands  
And talk about our little plans, alright  
Cold hard bitch just a kiss on the lips  
Then I was on my knees, I'm waitin', give me  
Cold hard bitch she was shakin' her hips  
So that was all that I needed, I'm waitin', give me  
Cold hard bitch just a kiss on the lips  
And I was on my knees  
Yeah I'm waitin', yeah I'm waitin'  
Yeah I'm waitin', yeah I'm waitin'  
Yeah, yeah  
Cold hard bitch just a kiss on the lips  
Then I was on my knees, I'm waitin', give me  
Cold hard bitch she was shakin' her hips  
So that was all that I needed, I'm waitin', give me  
Cold hard bitch just a kiss on the lips  
And I was on my knees, I'm waitin' give me
