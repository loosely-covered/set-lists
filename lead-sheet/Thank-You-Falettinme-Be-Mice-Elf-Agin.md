Lookin' at the devil,

We begin to wrestle  
I was on the top

Many thangs is on my mind,

Dance to the music  
All nite long  
Everyday people  
Sing a simple song

### Verse  8x
Flamin' eyes of people fear,  
burnin' into you  
Many men are missin' much,  
hatin' what they do  

Youth and truth are makin' love  
Dig it for a starter  
Dyin' young is hard to take  
Sellin' out is harder
